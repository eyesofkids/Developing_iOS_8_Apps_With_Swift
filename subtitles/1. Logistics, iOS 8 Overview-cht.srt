00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:17,147
Welcome to Stanford CS193P,this is winter quarter 2015.
歡迎參加史丹佛大學 2015 年冬季學期的 CS193P 課程

5
00:00:17,149 --> 00:00:21,718
And we're gonna dive right in today to some brief slide work.
我們首先簡要地概覽一下今天課程的內容

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,357
This people at Stanford, you've got a document that describe, describes all the grading and all that stuff
在座的同學，你們手裡都有一份敘述評分標準的文件，

8
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:32,126
so I'm not gonna go over that in lecture like I often do to start the quarter.
所以我不想像以往開課時那樣再重覆說明一遍

9
00:00:33,663 --> 00:00:36,296
Instead I'm gonna talk a little bit about, what this class is about.
相反，我首先要談一談，這門課到底是有關什麼的

10
00:00:37,566 --> 00:00:42,068
Brief mention of the prerequisites cuz they're pretty important in this class.
接下來簡單會提到學習本課程的先修課程，因為這對於本課程滿重要的

11
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:44,870
Then just the quickest overview of iOS.
然後會對 iOS 進行一個快速預覽

12
00:00:44,872 --> 00:00:49,508
I'm gonna assume that anyone who is here or is watching this, knows what that is.
我想假定在座的和觀看影片的各位同學，都知道那是什麼吧

13
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:51,609
And then, we're gonna dive right into a big old demo.
接下來，我們將會進入一個大的舊的 demo

14
00:00:51,611 --> 00:00:54,779
It's gonna be a two-day thing, where I'm really going to try and
這個會用兩節課內容，在這裡裡我會試著

15
00:00:54,781 --> 00:00:57,381
introduce you to Xcode and the development environment and
向你們介紹Xcode、開發環境以及

16
00:00:57,383 --> 00:01:01,818
this language Swift, that you're gonna have to learn to develop for iOS.
程式語言 Swift，這是當你在iOS上開發時將會需要學的

17
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:04,120
All right, so what is this class about?
好的，那麼本課程是關於什麼的呢？

18
00:01:04,122 --> 00:01:06,455
It's about building cool apps, as we know.
這門課是有關於開發超酷的App，正如我們所知道的

19
00:01:06,457 --> 00:01:09,091
Why are these iOS apps so cool?
為什麼這些 iOS Apps這麼酷呢？

20
00:01:09,093 --> 00:01:11,960
Well, because the device you're gonna run them on is in your pocket or
因為執行這些Apps的設備要不是在你的口袋裡，

21
00:01:11,962 --> 00:01:14,229
in your backpack.
不然就在你的背包裡

22
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:16,497
Either, if you write an app, you can just pull it out and show your friends and
又或者，如果你寫了一個App，你可以把它發佈出來，然後秀給你的朋友看

23
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,535
it's highly networked and incredible graphics with animation.
它高度地網路化，而且有令人驚奇的動畫圖形效果

24
00:01:20,537 --> 00:01:24,605
It's just cool all the way around and I think you guys all know that or you wouldn't be here.
它在各個方面都很 cool 我想你們應該都知道這些，否則你們就不會坐在這裡了

26
00:01:24,607 --> 00:01:28,374
But you're also gonna learn in this class a lot of real life Object-Oriented Programming.
在這們課程中，你們也需要學習一些關於面向對象編程的知識

28
00:01:28,377 --> 00:01:32,578
You're taking a lot of other classes here at Stanford on things like graphics, and
你們也可能在史丹佛參加過一些關於圖形、

29
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:39,718
networking, and databases, and maybe animation. Things like that.
網絡、數據庫也許還有動畫方面的課程

31
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:42,586
And we're gonna is kinda tie that all together into a real world class.
然而我們將這些內容融合在一起，

32
00:01:42,589 --> 00:01:44,055
'Kay? You're gonna get to see all this stuff.
你們會在本課程內看到所有這些東西

33
00:01:44,057 --> 00:01:46,891
Now, you know, it's gonna be kind of a survey course in that,
現在，你應該知道這會是一個概述型課程，

34
00:01:46,893 --> 00:01:52,462
I can't go too deep into networking. I can't go too deep into databases.
我不會深入講述網絡的內容，我不會深入講述數據庫的內容，

36
00:01:52,464 --> 00:01:56,366
I can't go too deep into animation, but you'll get to see it all in a really real
我不會深入講述動畫的內容，但是你們會在

37
00:01:56,368 --> 00:01:59,569
world environment, where people out there building apps using that technology.
真實項目的環境中用到所有的這些技術

38
00:01:59,571 --> 00:02:04,940
For some of you who haven't seen that before that'll be a big bonus of this class, I think.
我認為，對於一些之前沒有接觸過這些的同學，本課程對他們會有很大的提升

40
00:02:06,243 --> 00:02:07,975
The prerequisites of this class.
學習本課程的先決條件

41
00:02:07,977 --> 00:02:11,712
Number one thing is you have to be a pretty strong Object-Oriented programmer.
最重要的，你需要有很好的面向對象編程功底

42
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:14,014
If you're not a strong Object-Oriented programmer, and
如果你不是，

43
00:02:14,016 --> 00:02:18,018
you hit this class, you're probably gonna go under water, pretty quick.
還選了這個課，你可能很快就會掉隊了

44
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:22,188
Okay? I'm gonna assume you know, everything about Object-Oriented Programming.
我假設你已經瞭解關於面向對象編程的一切

46
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:26,658
iOS is a completely Object-Oriented Programming envir, development environment.
iOS 是一個完全的面向對象編程的開發環境

48
00:02:26,659 --> 00:02:28,859
I just don't mean I'm not just talking about the language is Object-Oriented.
我的意思不只是說程式語言是面向對象的

49
00:02:28,862 --> 00:02:31,863
But the entire design of it the way you use it if you're not
在你使用過程中，它的整個設計方式都是面向對象的 如果你

50
00:02:31,865 --> 00:02:33,965
comfortable with things like subclassing and
不熟悉類似於子類之類的東西，

51
00:02:33,967 --> 00:02:37,935
stuff like that then you're just really gonna be behind the curve.
那麼你真的有可能真的跟不上了

52
00:02:37,937 --> 00:02:42,239
In iOS so at Stanford here that means CS16A and B or
史丹佛編程相關課程有 CS16A、CA16B、

53
00:02:42,241 --> 00:02:47,344
CS16X, and then you know, CS107, while it's not really Object-Oriented course,
CS16X、以及 CS107，雖然它並不是專門的面向對象課程，

54
00:02:47,346 --> 00:02:49,746
at least it's a heavy duty programming course.
但至少是一門重量級的編程課程

55
00:02:49,748 --> 00:02:52,615
CS108 is a great Object-Oriented course so
CS108 是非常好的面向對象課程

56
00:02:52,617 --> 00:02:55,918
if you have, if you've taken CS108 you'll probably, be really well prepped.
如果你曾經參加過 CS108，你可能已經有了充分的準備

57
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,555
110, again not really too much an Object-Oriented program but
CS110，同樣也沒有太多關於面向對象的知識，

58
00:03:00,557 --> 00:03:03,057
good programming course cuz there's a lot of programming in this class,
但同樣是一門非常好的編程課程，因為其中有大量的編程實踐

59
00:03:03,059 --> 00:03:05,159
in fact, all the work in this class is programming.
事實上，所有這些課程的內容都是關於編程的

60
00:03:05,161 --> 00:03:08,395
You will not have, a little bit of reading the first couple of weeks just to
在頭幾個星期，你們需要為了學習新語言，多做一些閱讀

61
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:12,299
kinda learn this new language, but it's almost all programming after that all
在這之後，一直到最終的項目，

62
00:03:12,301 --> 00:03:14,467
the way til the end, including your final project.
都需要運用到你新學到的語言進行編程任務

63
00:03:14,469 --> 00:03:17,804
So if you're not really comfortable with all these terms,
所以，如果你真的不適應面向對象編程，

64
00:03:17,806 --> 00:03:21,674
this Object-Oriented terms or if you're just not really comfortable with
或者你真的不太適應寫較大的程序，

65
00:03:21,676 --> 00:03:26,178
writing big programs then this class will definitely be a challenge for you.
那麼這門課程對你來說將是一個巨大的挑戰

66
00:03:27,848 --> 00:03:30,682
okay, so what's in iOS, what are the parts of it?
那麼，iOS 都包括哪些部分呢？

67
00:03:30,684 --> 00:03:34,085
You know, it's ha, it's such a big system, it's got so much in it.
它是一個龐大的系統，其中包含很多部分

68
00:03:34,087 --> 00:03:38,254
It's impossible for me to, like, encapsulate it into a small little summary but.
不太可能能用一兩句話將其表述完整

70
00:03:38,257 --> 00:03:42,659
I do have this slide right here that divides it into these four layers.
我在這個 slides 中，將其分為四層

71
00:03:42,661 --> 00:03:46,763
These four layers are approximately down near the hardware at the bottom.
這四層從靠近硬件的底層，

72
00:03:46,765 --> 00:03:48,964
Up near the user at the top. Okay?
到靠近用戶的頂層

74
00:03:48,966 --> 00:03:52,284
So at the bottom, so
在最下面一層，

75
00:03:52,285 --> 00:03:55,603
a lot of people don't realize that iOS is basically a Unix-based operating system.
很多人沒有注意到，iOS 基本就是一個基於 Unix 的操作系統

76
00:03:55,605 --> 00:04:01,559
'Kay? It's very similar shares a lot of the core of Mac OS X. Okay?
它大量借鑒了 Mac OS X 的內核部分

79
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,911
Now, it's certainly optimized for mobile devices, which have
當然，它專門為在電池等等方面受到限制的移動設備優化過的，

80
00:04:03,913 --> 00:04:08,748
battery restrictions and things like that, but that is basically what it is.
但基本上它仍可看作是一個 Unix 系統

81
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,517
And so down at that layer you've got sockets, and
這樣的話，在這層中包含了 socket（套接字）、

82
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,121
you've got you know, permissions, and things like that,
permission（權限） 等等類似的部分

83
00:04:15,123 --> 00:04:19,191
that have to be near the oh you know, hardware to, to work properly.
它靠近底層硬件，並保證其正常工作

84
00:04:19,193 --> 00:04:23,495
But above that there's kind of an Object-Oriented layer that lets you get at
在這之上，是一個能夠讓你使用大量的面向對象編程技術的

85
00:04:23,497 --> 00:04:26,731
a lot of that stuff using Object-Oriented Programming.
面向對象的層

86
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:30,234
'Kay? And this stuff is not UI oriented it's
但是這層不包含 UI

87
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:34,171
more kind of accessing the hardware through Object-Oriented Programming or
其更多用於通過面向對象的編程方式訪問硬件，

88
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:36,373
accessing networking through Object-Oriented Programming but
或者訪問網絡，等等

89
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:39,309
it's a big layer there and so we will spend a fair amount of
它是一個很大的層，我們將花大量時間在該層上，

90
00:04:39,311 --> 00:04:44,980
time in this layer because we need those primitives to build at the higher layers.
因為我們需要這些原始組件來建立更高的層

91
00:04:44,982 --> 00:04:48,450
Then, there's this whole layer, which I wish we had more time to spend on.
我希望我們有更多時間花在這一層，

92
00:04:48,452 --> 00:04:50,252
We only get ten weeks in this whole class.
但是我們的課程只有十周

93
00:04:50,254 --> 00:04:54,655
It goes by so fast, you'll be amazed, as you're probably, used to with your Stanford courses.
在史丹佛的課程中，你會感嘆時間過得如此之快

95
00:04:55,758 --> 00:04:58,092
But there's a whole media layer here, both for
再往上，是一整個媒體層，

96
00:04:58,094 --> 00:05:02,062
static images, as you know, JPEG and things like that.
包括比如你們熟悉的 JPEG 等的靜態圖像，

97
00:05:02,064 --> 00:05:07,700
And video both capturing video, editing video, all that.
包括拍攝影片、編輯影片等的影片處理，

98
00:05:07,702 --> 00:05:13,706
Incredible audio, the frameworks on this device for doing 3D audio for games and all that.
不可思議的音頻框架，用於處理 3D 音效，以及遊戲等等

100
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:16,675
I get to, unfortunately I get to very little of this layer.
很不幸，我對這層知道的並不多

101
00:05:16,677 --> 00:05:20,879
But I'll try to let you know, that it's in there and then you'll know to go out and
但是我可以告訴你它裡面有什麼，這樣你用到的時候就可以查閱相關資料，

102
00:05:20,881 --> 00:05:23,948
seek out, if you're building a very audio intensive app or
或者當你正在寫一個用到大量音頻影片技術的應用的時候，

103
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,484
video intensive app, you'll seek out that layer.
你會知道去哪找這些資料

104
00:05:26,486 --> 00:05:32,756
But we'll spend the vast majority of our time at the Cocoa Touch layer.
我們會在 Cocoa Touch 層上花費大量的時間

105
00:05:32,758 --> 00:05:35,325
So the Cocoa Touch layer, that's where the buttons and
Cocoa Touch 層里包含了 button，

106
00:05:35,327 --> 00:05:38,895
sliders and things like that are it's the layer,
slider 等類似的控件，

107
00:05:38,897 --> 00:05:43,032
where you're gonna build the interactivity with your end user.
你可以通過它們來和你的用戶建立互動

108
00:05:43,034 --> 00:05:47,936
And so, that's where we probably spend 70 plus percent of our time in the Cocoa Touch layer.
我們會在 Cocoa Touch 上花費 70% 甚至更多的時間

110
00:05:47,938 --> 00:05:50,271
And this is a very powerful layer.
這也是一個非常強大的層

111
00:05:50,273 --> 00:05:54,809
You know, you've seen things like the maps app on the phone.
你們可能在手機上見過地圖類的應用

112
00:05:54,811 --> 00:05:58,346
There's basically, an object that does almost the entire maps app, that you can
事實上，有一個幾乎完整的地圖應用對象，

113
00:05:58,348 --> 00:06:01,482
just drop right into your program, and now you have maps in your program.
你只需要直接拖進你的程序里，你的程序中就有地圖了

114
00:06:01,484 --> 00:06:04,051
Same thing with web browser.
同樣的還有瀏覽器

115
00:06:04,052 --> 00:06:06,619
If you wanna put web browsing in your app, it's just boom, pop an object in there,
如果你想讓你的應用有瀏覽網頁的功能，那麼僅僅需要拖拽一個對象，

116
00:06:06,622 --> 00:06:08,655
call a couple methods and in your, on your way.
再調用幾個方法即可

117
00:06:08,657 --> 00:06:13,592
So very powerful, very high level in there's a lot going on in there and
所以在強大和高級的 Cocoa Touch ，我們會瞭解很多，

118
00:06:13,594 --> 00:06:16,195
that's where we will spend most of our time, 'kay?
並且在此花費大量的時間

119
00:06:16,197 --> 00:06:19,831
And by the way, if you have any questions I try to glance up, so
順便說一下，我抬眼一瞥的時候，

120
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,499
the bright lights over there sometimes in my way,
有可能會看到你們的提問，但是有時我也會注意不到，

121
00:06:21,501 --> 00:06:25,302
but, shout out or you know, otherwise get my attention.
所以盡量讓我注意到你

122
00:06:25,304 --> 00:06:28,105
If you feel free to interrupt.
如果你感覺打斷我沒什麼問題的話

123
00:06:28,107 --> 00:06:31,308
Then there's the development platform itself.'Kay?
接下來就是開發平台本身

125
00:06:31,309 --> 00:06:32,809
With the tools we use to build these iOS apps.
我們會用這些工具來搭建 iOS 應用

126
00:06:32,811 --> 00:06:34,978
What's in that?
其中都有什麼？

127
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:39,048
Well, it's all pretty much now been funneled into this one application called Xcode 6.
有很多很棒的工具都集成在 Xcode 6 內

129
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:42,418
There are some little adjuncts that it calls out to but
可能還有其它一些輔助編程工具，

130
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:45,287
Xcode 6 is everything, it's your code editor,
但是 Xcode 6，你值得擁有，它是一個代碼編輯器，

131
00:06:45,289 --> 00:06:50,024
it's your compiler, your debugger all of that in one, pretty awesome app.
它是一個編譯器，是一個調試器，總之是一個很棒的應用

132
00:06:50,026 --> 00:06:54,395
And so we'll be learning all about Xcode 6 in this class, and
所以我們這個課程里會講到很多有關 Xcode 6 的知識

133
00:06:54,397 --> 00:06:59,366
that's where you'll be spend all your time developing, you're not gonna be at
而你編程的時候會一直使用 Xcode，你不需要

134
00:06:59,368 --> 00:07:04,337
a terminal typing in Emacs or something, you're gonna be in Xcode 6.
在終端下用 Emacs 或其他的編輯器，你只需要使用 Xcode 6

135
00:07:04,339 --> 00:07:08,874
Languages I have there's actually, two languages in iOS now.
現在可以使用兩種語言開發 iOS 應用

136
00:07:08,876 --> 00:07:12,044
There are peers that you can pretty much use either one.
你可以選擇使用任何一個

137
00:07:12,046 --> 00:07:14,079
One of them is called Objective-C,
其中一個名為 Objective-C，

138
00:07:14,081 --> 00:07:17,715
that's the language that iOS was originally developed for.
它也是 iOS 一直以來使用的開發語言

139
00:07:17,717 --> 00:07:22,553
It's a language been around a long time, probably 30 years it's been around or 25
這個語言已經有大概 25 到 30 年的歷史了，

140
00:07:22,555 --> 00:07:27,123
to 30 years that's it's actually been used to build stuff that's on the Mac today.
人們用它為 Mac 開發應用

141
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:32,194
So, it's very mature language but it's also 25, 30 years old.
因此，它是非常成熟的語言，但是已經 25，30 歲了

142
00:07:32,196 --> 00:07:36,965
And so Apple last summer introduced a completely new language called Swift, and
所以蘋果公司在去年夏天發佈了一個叫 Swift 的全新的語言，

143
00:07:36,967 --> 00:07:40,669
Swift, you can do pretty much everything in iOS with Swift，
你可以使用 Swift 在 iOS 上開發任何應用，

144
00:07:40,671 --> 00:07:45,172
that's the language we're gonna learn because it's a modern language.
它也是本次課我們要學習的語言，它是一門現代的語言

145
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:48,709
Apple did a great job of kind of, building all the best stuff of
為了創建 Swift，蘋果公司做了很多工作，

146
00:07:48,711 --> 00:07:52,346
all the languages that have been invented over the last, you know,
它吸收了很多已存在的程式語言的優點

147
00:07:52,348 --> 00:07:57,684
25 years of this especially the last five or ten years into this language.
二十五年以來，特別是近五到十年的語言的優點

148
00:07:57,686 --> 00:08:02,988
It's very concise it's a very type safe language but has type inference and a lot
它語法簡潔，類型安全，並且還有類型推斷以及

149
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:06,991
of things that make it so that you get the best of both worlds by having type safety-
大量的特性，可以同時擁有類型安全，

150
00:08:06,993 --> 00:08:11,295
And not have to be constantly over specifying everything.
又不需要不斷地指定各種類型

152
00:08:11,297 --> 00:08:14,665
So we're gonna go Swift only, I'm not even gonna really talk about Objective-C,
所以我們只使用 Swift，不會講太多 Objective-C，

153
00:08:14,667 --> 00:08:16,400
I just don't have time to do both languages.
我也沒有時間講兩種語言

154
00:08:16,402 --> 00:08:19,786
Yeah. >>
（學生提問）

155
00:08:19,787 --> 00:08:23,171
（學生提問）

156
00:08:23,174 --> 00:08:26,275
>> Yeah, so the question is if I'm going out into the world to do
這個同學的問題是，如果我將步入社會，

157
00:08:26,277 --> 00:08:29,244
iOS development in the real world for real companies.
並想找一份做 iOS 開發的工作，

158
00:08:29,246 --> 00:08:30,912
Am I probably, gonna have to learn Objective-C?
我是否還需要學習 Objective-C？

159
00:08:30,914 --> 00:08:34,049
And the answer is it depends on the company you're at.
答案是，這取決於你的公司

160
00:08:34,051 --> 00:08:36,017
Probably in the short term, yes.
可能在短期內，答案是肯定的

161
00:08:36,019 --> 00:08:39,920
But as the time goes by probably, more and more people switch to siff, Swift.
但是隨著時間的推移，可能有越來越多的人會轉到 Swift

162
00:08:39,922 --> 00:08:43,490
The good thing is the underlying iOS
好消息這兩門語言在 iOS 之下的 API

163
00:08:43,492 --> 00:08:45,926
APIs are exactly the same for both, its just the syntax-
是完全相同的，

164
00:08:45,928 --> 00:08:49,162
Of the language a little bit
僅僅只是語法上

165
00:08:49,163 --> 00:08:52,397
about how the language approaches calling the API is slightly different, but any,
會有略微的不同，但是

166
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,734
everything that you learn in here about the underlying,
你們在這裡學習的 iOS 的部分，

167
00:08:54,736 --> 00:08:57,636
lying parts of iOS will totally work in Objective-C.
使用 Objective-C 完全也可以實現

168
00:08:57,638 --> 00:08:59,571
All the methods are the same you know,
所有的方法都是一樣的，

169
00:08:59,573 --> 00:09:00,939
it's just the syntax is a little different.
僅僅只有語法上的一點區別

170
00:09:00,941 --> 00:09:02,540
So, don't feel too bad about not
所以對於沒有學全兩門語言，

171
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,276
learning both languages, and once you've learned this language,
不要感到沮喪，一旦你掌握了 Swift，

172
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:07,911
learning Objective-C is gonna be pretty easy, too.
再學 Objective-C 也很快

173
00:09:07,913 --> 00:09:11,815
So. Good question though. All right.
這個問題問得很好

175
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:14,617
Of course iOS is filled with tons of frameworks.
當然，iOS 內部擁有眾多的框架，

176
00:09:14,619 --> 00:09:18,320
Frameworks are libraries, basically, of objects that you use,
框架就是你會用到的類庫以及基本對象

177
00:09:18,322 --> 00:09:20,989
as building blocks to build your application.
作為搭建你的應用的模塊，

178
00:09:20,991 --> 00:09:23,325
And we are going to be covering them.
我們也會學習它們

179
00:09:23,327 --> 00:09:25,193
UIKit is the main one.
UIKit 就是其中主要的一個

180
00:09:25,195 --> 00:09:27,829
It's got most of the user interface stuff in it.
它包含了大量的關於用戶界面的內容

181
00:09:27,831 --> 00:09:32,266
Foundation is that most the Core Service layer that I was talking about,
在 Core Service 中，我提及最多的就是 Foundation 框架

182
00:09:32,268 --> 00:09:37,070
and but there's tons of other ones, Core Motion for doing the, the device moving
其他還有很多，Core Motion 框架用於處理設備移動、

183
00:09:37,072 --> 00:09:42,075
around, you know, gyro and accelerometer, Core Data for Object-Oriented database.
旋轉、陀螺及加速度等響應，Core Data 框架用於操作面向對象的數據庫，

184
00:09:42,077 --> 00:09:44,961
Things like that.
等等

185
00:09:44,962 --> 00:09:47,846
So I'll get to, as many as those as I can, especially the big ones.
我會盡我所能盡可能多的傳授給你們，特別是那些大的框架

186
00:09:47,848 --> 00:09:50,849
But there's just way too many to cover in ten weeks.
但是這對一個只有十周的課程來說，內容太多了

187
00:09:51,851 --> 00:09:58,188
And finally we I, I put this, as a first class thing with all the rest, as a design strategy MVC.
然而以上的那些東西均不是我們第一課要講的內容 我首先要說的是一個叫做 MVC 的設計模式

189
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:01,124
I think, I usually ask, I'll all ask this year, too.
每年我都會問，同樣今年我也要問這個問題，

190
00:10:01,126 --> 00:10:05,361
How many people have used MVC in some other class?
你們有多少同學曾經在其他課上用過 MVC？

191
00:10:05,363 --> 00:10:07,196
See, so it's half of you.
哦，有一半的同學

192
00:10:07,198 --> 00:10:09,698
So I'll be teaching MVC, as if you don't know it, so
有同學不知道，那麼我先說說 MVC

193
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,599
if you don't know it don't worry.
就算你不瞭解它，也不用擔心

194
00:10:11,601 --> 00:10:15,636
But MVC is a way of designing your application so that it's a little more
MVC 是你設計應用的一種方式，用它設計的代碼

195
00:10:15,638 --> 00:10:21,141
debuggable, reusable understandable to you and to anyone reading your code.
無論對於你自己或者其他人都具有可讀性，也更易調試，易復用

196
00:10:21,143 --> 00:10:25,278
And iOS was designed with MVC from the start.
而 iOS 從一開始就使用 MVC 設計

197
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,214
So it's just integral part to building an iOS.
而這僅僅是創建一個 iOS 應用整體中的一部分

198
00:10:28,216 --> 00:10:33,452
Now, I'm gonna do the demo today, and on Wednesday I'm kinda not gonna follow MVC.
我要開始做今天的 demo，但是在週三的課上不會使用 MVC

199
00:10:33,454 --> 00:10:37,922
But then next Monday we're gonna apply MVC to the demo I'm doing today and
但是下週一我會應用 MVC 繼續今天的 demo，

200
00:10:37,924 --> 00:10:41,426
Wednesday, so you're gonna get the full MVC treatment there.
週三的時候你們就會對 MVC 有了充分的理解

201
00:10:41,428 --> 00:10:45,262
And I'll be having some slides on MVC on Wednesday to prepare you for next Monday.
然後在週三我會放一些 MVC 的 slides 來為下週一做準備

202
00:10:46,832 --> 00:10:49,699
Okay? All right, so here's the demo.
好，下面開始做 demo

203
00:10:49,701 --> 00:10:53,936
The demo I'm gonna do, is something I actually did a few years ago that really works well-
接下來我要做的 demo，是我前幾年做的一個計算器，運行起來還不錯

205
00:10:53,938 --> 00:10:55,971
With Swift, which is a calculator.
我們用 Swift 來實現它

206
00:10:55,973 --> 00:10:57,373
So, we're gonna build this calculator.
現在，我們來創建這個計算器

207
00:10:57,375 --> 00:11:00,509
And we're gonna build it from scratch, all the way.
我們將從頭開始，一步一步創建它

208
00:11:00,511 --> 00:11:04,545
And I like to do my demos, where I only type in stuff, I don't copy and
我喜歡動手敲代碼來做演示，而不會複製或者

209
00:11:04,547 --> 00:11:06,914
paste big chunks of code in or whatever.
粘貼大段代碼什麼的

210
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,817
I know, I'd see a lot of laptops open, a lot of people like to try and
我知道，我看到很多人已經打開筆記本電腦，很多人都喜歡

211
00:11:09,819 --> 00:11:12,736
follow along with me.
跟著我親自動手嘗試

212
00:11:12,737 --> 00:11:15,654
I'm a fast typer, but usually in most demos you can keep, keep up if you want.
我打字速度很快，但是通常在大多數演示中，只要你想，還是能夠跟上我的速度

213
00:11:15,657 --> 00:11:20,426
I don't recommend it necessarily, or certainly I don't require it.
我並不推薦這麼做，或者說不必要這樣

214
00:11:20,428 --> 00:11:28,400
I am going to, you, you'll be able to go back and watch this particular demo on video.
你們可以回去看影片

216
00:11:28,402 --> 00:11:30,535
Even Stanford people will be able to do that.
史丹佛的學生也可以這麼做

217
00:11:30,537 --> 00:11:34,805
Because your first assignment is gonna be to reproduce what I do.
因為你們的第一次作業是要重現我所做的

218
00:11:34,807 --> 00:11:37,041
'Kay? That is 90% of your first assignment.
這就是你第一次作業的 90%

219
00:11:37,043 --> 00:11:40,277
Reproduce what I'm gonna do, today and on Wednesday.
重現我今天和星期三做的

220
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:42,946
So I'm not gonna post the code because I want you to go through the experience of
我不會把代碼給你，因為我想讓你自己動手敲代碼

221
00:11:42,948 --> 00:11:45,615
typing the code in, and if you watch in on video,
如果你是在看這個影片，

222
00:11:45,617 --> 00:11:51,219
watching what I do again, and and typing it all in. 'Kay?
看一遍我乾了什麼，然後自己敲代碼

224
00:11:51,221 --> 00:11:56,340
And I'll explain that all on Wednesday. Okay?
我將在週三對所有問題做解釋

226
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:58,224
So, I put on the slide a bunch of things that I'm gonna cover, but I'm not gonna go
我把一些將要提及的部分放到了 slides 里，但我不會提前

227
00:11:58,227 --> 00:12:01,628
over it in advance, I'm just gonna sit, sit and soon I'll start doing it.
給你們講這些內容 我要坐下，然後開始演示

228
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:04,498
So any questions before I dive in here?
在這之前還有什麼問題嗎？

229
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,401
I know we're gonna little fast, but I wanna maximize your learning time.
我知道我講得有點快，因為我想最大化你們的學習時間

230
00:12:08,403 --> 00:12:11,870
-（同學提問）

231
00:12:11,872 --> 00:12:12,771
Direct of what?
什麼？

232
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:14,706
-（同學提問）

233
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:18,142
So the question is, which Xcode should we use, should you use?
問題是，我們應該用哪個版本的 Xcode？

234
00:12:18,144 --> 00:12:20,811
Well, you should just use the one on the Mac App Store.
你們直接使用在 Mac App Store 上的那個版本就好了

235
00:12:20,813 --> 00:12:23,247
So, just go to the Mac App Store, it's free.
去 Mac App Store 上免費下載

236
00:12:23,249 --> 00:12:25,482
Use the one there, whatever the latest one is.
使用那裡的最新的版本

237
00:12:25,484 --> 00:12:28,618
If a new one comes out in the quarter, well, let's all switch over to it.
如果有更新的版本出來，那麼我們就更新

238
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,620
Okay, let's just always be using the latest Xcode.
總之我們用的是最新版本的 Xcode

239
00:12:30,622 --> 00:12:31,354
'Kay any-
還有問題嗎？

240
00:12:31,356 --> 00:12:32,621
（同學提問）

241
00:12:32,623 --> 00:12:35,624
Not. We're not gonna using a beta or anything like that.
不，我們不用測試版或者類似的一些版本

243
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,392
We'll just use whatever the currently published Xcode is.
我們只用當前最新的 Xcode

244
00:12:38,995 --> 00:12:41,746
Okay.

245
00:12:41,747 --> 00:12:44,498
So, I'm going to start this demo actually by launching Xcode.
那麼我要開始運行 Xcode 來演示了

246
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:50,669
So, here it is, right here. Xcode.
在這 Xcode

248
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:53,270
And when you launch Xcode, let's hide others here.
運行 Xcode 以後，我們把其他東西隱藏起來

249
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,140
You're gonna get this splash screen and
你會看到這個歡迎界面，

250
00:12:55,142 --> 00:12:58,376
on this splash screen on the right, this is gonna be all your projects.
在歡迎界面的右邊，將顯示你所有的項目

251
00:12:58,378 --> 00:13:00,711
Now, since it's the beginning of the quarter, we don't have any projects yet,
由於這是本學期開始，我們還沒有任何項目

252
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:04,048
but they'll all be listed here, so as the quarter goes by this will fill up.
但是慢慢的，我們會逐漸將這個列表填滿

253
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:07,284
You can turn this splash screen off, if you don't like it by the way.
如果你不喜歡這個歡迎頁面，可以將它關閉

254
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:10,820
This splash screen also lets us do things like playgrounds and
歡迎界面中也可以創建例如 playground，

255
00:13:10,822 --> 00:13:13,256
a source code management right down here.
或者源代碼管理，在這裡

256
00:13:13,258 --> 00:13:15,024
We're not gonna be doing that for a while.
我們在很長一段時間內不會碰那些

257
00:13:15,026 --> 00:13:16,859
We're gonna be focusing on this option, right here.
我們需要關注的是這個選項，這裡

258
00:13:16,861 --> 00:13:18,760
Create a new Xcode project.
創建一個新的 Xcode 項目

259
00:13:18,762 --> 00:13:23,748
If you don't have the splash screen, you can go to File > New > Project. Kay.
如果你看不到歡迎界面，你也可以 File > New > Project

261
00:13:23,749 --> 00:13:25,032
Same thing, those both the same thing.
它們都是一樣的

262
00:13:25,034 --> 00:13:28,469
So I'm gonna click right here on Create a new project.
下面我點擊這裡，創建一個新項目

263
00:13:28,471 --> 00:13:31,605
When I create a new project, it wants to know what kind of project you want to create,
當我創建新項目的時候，它需要知道你想創建什麼類型的項目

264
00:13:31,607 --> 00:13:38,494
because Xcode is actually used on Mac OS X and to build frameworks and all that stuff.
Xcode 可以被用於在 Mac OS X 上創建框架，以及所有類似的東西

266
00:13:38,495 --> 00:13:41,079
But we're always gonna be building iOS Applications.
但是我們將要創建的是 iOS 應用

267
00:13:41,082 --> 00:13:43,382
And in fact, we're always gonna use this template right here,
事實上，我們經常用到這裡的模板，

268
00:13:43,384 --> 00:13:47,236
Single View Application.'Kay?
Single View Application

270
00:13:47,237 --> 00:13:49,688
That's kind of your basic MVC starter application and
這就是你的基礎 MVC 入門應用

271
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:53,724
we're gonna build very complicated apps out of that, but we're gonna start here,
我們會用其他這些創建非常複雜的應用，但是我們從這裡開始

272
00:13:53,726 --> 00:13:55,592
so you always click on that one.
所以你會經常點這個

273
00:13:55,594 --> 00:13:58,528
Then it wants to know what you want to call your app, and
你需要填寫應用的名稱，

274
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:04,634
we're building a calculator, so we're gonna call our app, Calculator.'Kay?
我們在創建的是計算器應用，所以我們給它起名為，Calculator

276
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:06,669
This organization name doesn't really matter that's just gonna appear in
orgnization 並不重要，它只會出現在

277
00:14:06,671 --> 00:14:10,339
copyright notice and the code that you write at the top in a comment so
類似版權信息，或者你的代碼開頭的注釋中，所以

278
00:14:10,341 --> 00:14:12,291
don't worry about that.
不用管它

279
00:14:12,292 --> 00:14:14,242
But this organization identifier that is very important.
但是這裡的 organization Identifier 是非常重要的

280
00:14:14,244 --> 00:14:19,230
'Kay, this uniquely identifies you. Okay?
它是你的唯一標識符

282
00:14:19,231 --> 00:14:20,848
So that on the next line we can you just,
所以在下一行裡，我們需要一個新的

283
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:23,950
new uniquely idefy, identify your calculator.
唯一的標識符，標識你的計算器

284
00:14:23,952 --> 00:14:26,219
So here if your a Stanford student,
所以如果你是史丹佛的學生，

285
00:14:26,221 --> 00:14:31,490
you'll wanna use this reverse DNS notation here edu.stanford.cs193p.
你可以用這個倒序的域名：edu.stanford.cs193p

286
00:14:31,492 --> 00:14:36,661
And instead of instructor there, you wanna put your SU net ID.'Kay?
並用你的 SU net ID 將 instructor 替換

288
00:14:36,663 --> 00:14:37,929
Cuz nobody else has that but you.
因為你的 ID 不會和別人的重復

289
00:14:37,931 --> 00:14:39,864
And that'll uniquely identify you.
這樣這個標識符就能作為唯一標識你

290
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:44,201
As I said, we're using Swift not Objective-C.
我說過，我們要用 Swift 而不是 Objective-C

291
00:14:44,203 --> 00:14:49,272
And we're gonna build an app that works be, equally well on iPad and iPhone,
我們要創建的應用要能同時工作在 iPad 和 iPhone 上，

292
00:14:49,274 --> 00:14:51,507
that's called a universal app.
所以選擇 Universal

293
00:14:51,509 --> 00:14:54,209
You can pick to develop for only one or the other.
你也可以選擇只為其中一種設備開發

294
00:14:54,211 --> 00:14:56,745
But we are going to go Universal here.
但是我們在這裡選擇 Universal

295
00:14:56,747 --> 00:15:00,248
We're not gonna really be doing the iPad part of it for a couple weeks.
在這幾周之內我們不會做這個應用的 iPad 部分

296
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:04,352
But it is our intent to eventually build an app that works on both.
但是我們最終會把它設計成一個同時能夠運行在 iPad 和 iPhone 上的應用

297
00:15:04,354 --> 00:15:06,186
Okay we're not going to be using Core Data,
我們現在還用不到 Core Data

298
00:15:06,188 --> 00:15:09,322
that's object oriented database stuff so you just leave that unchecked.
那是面向對象的數據庫，現在先不選它

299
00:15:09,324 --> 00:15:13,993
And now it's asking where we want to save it, I strongly recommend saving in your
現在，它問我們要把項目保存在哪裡，我強烈建議保存在你的

300
00:15:13,995 --> 00:15:18,998
home directory, this is my home directory here in a folder called Developer, okay?
home 目錄下，這是我的 home 目錄，裡面有一個 Developer 的目錄，看到沒？

301
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,001
You could put other folders in here if you want to arrange it more,
當然你也可以在這裡放其它文件夾，如果你想創建更多的話

302
00:15:22,003 --> 00:15:25,103
but home directory Developer, I highly recommend that.
不過我建議你放在主目錄下的 Developer 文件夾

303
00:15:25,105 --> 00:15:28,273
Source Control, we will be talking about that at some point in the quarter but
Source Control，我們將會在這學期的某些時候講到，不過

304
00:15:28,275 --> 00:15:30,141
we're not gonna do it right off the bat here so
我們先跳過這個

305
00:15:30,143 --> 00:15:31,776
you can leave that unchecked as well.
所以那個選項你可以不打勾

306
00:15:33,045 --> 00:15:37,847
All right, so here's our first project, its been created so
好，這就是我們創建的第一個項目

307
00:15:37,849 --> 00:15:43,586
this is Xcode that your seeing right here, this is Xcode's main screen and
這裡你看到的就是 Xcode, 這是 Xcode 的主窗口

308
00:15:43,588 --> 00:15:46,955
the center is really what your working on.
中間這部分是主要的工作區域

309
00:15:46,957 --> 00:15:51,026
The left is, area here, is called the navigator, and the navigator you,
左邊的區域，被稱作 Navigator（導航欄）

310
00:15:51,028 --> 00:15:54,829
you use to kind of choose what you're working on but you can also do
通常用來選擇特定的選項，不過也你可以

311
00:15:54,831 --> 00:15:59,367
things over here like search hough your whole project, that's this little guy.
點擊這個小圖標，對整個項目進行搜索

312
00:15:59,369 --> 00:16:04,838
Look at all your break points maybe, look at previous builds that you've done,
這裡用來查看斷點，這裡用來查看之前編譯的項目

313
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:09,076
browse your project by class hierarchy, all that stuff.
這裡可以以類的層次結構展開整個項目，等等

314
00:16:09,078 --> 00:16:12,312
But we're usually on the left most one here which is just all of the files in
不過我們通常會點擊最左邊的這裡，這裡可以看到我們所有的文件

315
00:16:12,314 --> 00:16:17,750
your project which can also can be organized hierarchically like this.
你的項目可以像這樣按層次的展現出來

316
00:16:17,752 --> 00:16:19,585
And when you select something here on the left,
當你選擇左邊區域這裡的某些部分，

317
00:16:19,587 --> 00:16:23,588
the middle will fill up with what that you've selected so.
中間區域會出現你剛剛選擇的那部分內容

318
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:26,591
Here I have the actual project itself selected.
這裡我選擇了這個項目本身

319
00:16:26,593 --> 00:16:28,993
So these are the project settings of which there are tons.
所以這裡可以看到這個項目的很多設置項

320
00:16:28,995 --> 00:16:31,662
All along the top here you can see tons of settings.
在這上面你還可以看到更多設置項

321
00:16:31,664 --> 00:16:34,431
We're, we'll go through them as the quarter goes on and
隨著學期進展我們將會講到這些

322
00:16:34,433 --> 00:16:37,100
you've already seen some of them like the bundle identifier there and
你已經看到其中的一部分，比如這裡的 Bundle identifier（包標識符）

323
00:16:37,102 --> 00:16:38,702
the fact this is a universal app.
還可以看到這裡是一個通用 app

324
00:16:38,704 --> 00:16:41,037
We're not going to talk about anymore of this today,
不過我們今天不會講關於項目設置

325
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:42,805
this project settings business.
的更多內容

326
00:16:42,807 --> 00:16:45,107
We're gonna focus here on some of these files.
我們會把注意力集中在這些文件

327
00:16:45,109 --> 00:16:47,409
And even some of these files, like this AppDelegate,
甚至是這些文件，比如 AppDelegate

328
00:16:47,411 --> 00:16:50,845
I'm just gonna move that down to Supporting Files to get it out of the way.
我會把它們移到 Supporting Files

329
00:16:50,847 --> 00:16:53,081
Same things with these image assets,
image assets 文件夾也是

330
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:56,117
LaunchScreen well get to this later in the quarter.
LaunchScreen 我們之後會講到

331
00:16:56,119 --> 00:16:58,285
But I wanna focus on these two files right here.
不過我們現在會把注意力集中在這兩個文件上

332
00:16:58,287 --> 00:17:03,957
Okay Main.storyboard and ViewController.swift, okay
Main.storyboard 和 ViewController.swift

333
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:06,192
In the MVC world by the way, this is the V,
順便說，在 MVC 中這稱為 V

334
00:17:06,194 --> 00:17:10,896
the view and this is the C, the controller but we will talk about MVC on Wednesday.
即視圖，這是 C，即控制器，我們將在週三講到 MVC

335
00:17:11,999 --> 00:17:13,665
So what do these things contain?
所以，這些東西包含什麼

336
00:17:13,667 --> 00:17:16,234
So this Main.storyboard, if I click on it,
這是 Main.storyboard，如果我點擊它

337
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:18,936
you see it appear in the middle, this is our UI.
可以看到我們的 UI 出現在中間

338
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:21,972
Okay, this is our user interface.
這就是我們的 UI

339
00:17:21,973 --> 00:17:23,973
So for a calculator this is going to be a little display,
對於計算器而言，這裡將會是一個稍微小一點的顯示區域

340
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:27,811
this shows the number that we're working on or whatever at the top.
這裡會顯示我們計算出來的數字或任何其它在上面的數字

341
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:32,448
And lots of buttons down here, number buttons, times, multi, or sorry, times,
下面這裡會有很多按鈕，包括數字，乘除

342
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:34,917
divide, plus, minus, square root.
加減，平方根

343
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:36,451
That's all going to be here.
都會出現在這裡

344
00:17:36,453 --> 00:17:39,521
So we're going to build this entire user interface.
所以我們完全使用圖形化來搭建

345
00:17:39,523 --> 00:17:41,055
Purely graphically.
整個用戶界面

346
00:17:41,057 --> 00:17:43,057
Okay? We're not gonna be writing code.
我們不會寫代碼

347
00:17:43,059 --> 00:17:45,259
Put button at this location.
來指出哪個按鈕該放哪個位置

348
00:17:45,261 --> 00:17:47,411
None of that, okay?
一點代碼都沒有

349
00:17:47,412 --> 00:17:49,562
We just literally with our mouse are gonna build this whole user interface.
我們只是用我們的鼠標來搭建我們的用戶界面

350
00:17:50,499 --> 00:17:53,700
So what's the code, what do we need any code for?
那我們的代碼寫在哪裡，什麼時候需要寫代碼？

351
00:17:53,702 --> 00:17:57,203
Well, we, this ViewController.swift, this is a Swift file.
看 ViewController.swift，這個 Swift 文件

352
00:17:57,205 --> 00:18:00,539
This is your first look at Swift for most of you.
這是你們中多數人第一次看 Swift 文件

353
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:03,108
This controller is gonna control that user interface.
這是我們的 controller，用來控制我們的用戶界面

354
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:05,877
That's why we call it the view controller or the controller.
這就是為什麼我們稱之為 view controller 或 controller

355
00:18:05,879 --> 00:18:09,180
It controls user interface and that means it's gonna do things that
它控制 UI，這意味著它會做某些事情來

356
00:18:09,182 --> 00:18:13,651
are specific to how this user interface, a calculator's user interface, works.
比如指定這個 UI，計算器界面應該怎樣工作

357
00:18:13,653 --> 00:18:16,720
So when we press the digit buttons, it's going to have update the display.
這樣當你點擊數字按鈕，它會更新顯示的內容

358
00:18:16,722 --> 00:18:19,856
When we press times, it's gonna have to do some multiplication and
當我們點擊乘法，它將會進行乘法運算並且

359
00:18:19,858 --> 00:18:21,524
then put the result in the display.
把結果顯示出來

360
00:18:21,526 --> 00:18:24,227
So it's controlling the display.
所以說它會控制界面的展示

361
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:28,597
Okay so we'll get back to this code in a moment but we're gonna start by
我們稍後再回到這裡，現在我們先從搭建界面開始

362
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:33,802
building our user interface and by the way, your user interface, you can see I
順便說一句，你可以看到這個用戶界面

363
00:18:33,804 --> 00:18:39,140
have a low resolution screen here so my UI doesn't even really fit in the space here.
因為屏幕的低分辨率，所以我的 UI 沒有很好地適應空間

364
00:18:39,142 --> 00:18:42,677
You'll probably have maybe a little higher resolution screen then I do but
你們可能有比我更高的屏幕分辨率的屏幕

365
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:45,979
if you don't, you can zoom in and out, I'm just right-clicking,
不過如果你們沒有，你們可以通過右鍵點擊來進行放大和縮小

366
00:18:45,981 --> 00:18:49,516
if you right-click on the background area here, you can zoom in and out.
如果你在這個背景區域點擊右鍵，你可以放大縮小

367
00:18:49,518 --> 00:18:52,652
You can also do it by double-clicking so if I double-click on this,
你也可以採用雙擊，看如果我雙擊這裡

368
00:18:52,654 --> 00:18:56,122
it zooms it to normal, if I double-click on the background, it zooms out so
它放大到正常水平，如果我再雙擊背景，它會縮小

369
00:18:56,124 --> 00:18:57,523
that way I can see my whole UI.
這樣我可以看到我的整個 UI 界面

370
00:18:57,525 --> 00:18:59,992
Now when we build a complicated app
當我們完成了一個複雜的 app

371
00:18:59,994 --> 00:19:05,663
we're gonna have a whole bunch of these little square areas, we call these scenes,
我們將會有一大堆這些方塊區域，這些我們稱之為 scenes（場景）

372
00:19:05,665 --> 00:19:11,402
and a scene represents kind of phone full, phone screen full of information.
一個場景代表一個完整顯示所有信息的手機屏幕

373
00:19:11,404 --> 00:19:15,072
Okay and as you you've used many iOS applications, you know that you
就像你使用過的許多 iOS 程序

374
00:19:15,074 --> 00:19:20,443
transition from one screen to another as the user goes through the app and
你知道用戶使用這個 app 從一個屏幕切換到另外一個屏幕

375
00:19:20,445 --> 00:19:22,111
that's how your gonna build your apps as well.
這也是你搭建 app 的方式

376
00:19:22,113 --> 00:19:25,981
And this StoryBoard is eventually gonna have a big map showing all
這個 StoryBoard 最終將會有一個大的圖來顯示所有的

377
00:19:25,983 --> 00:19:28,951
the transitions between all those scenes.
場景間的切換

378
00:19:28,953 --> 00:19:31,019
Okay, so this StoryBoard is gonna get big for
好了，所以這個 StoryBoard 將會用來搭建

379
00:19:31,021 --> 00:19:35,323
big apps, your really gonna see your whole application which is kinda cool.
完整的 app，所以當你真的看到整個應用程序時，還挺 cool 的

380
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:39,893
So we're gonna start small though, just this one little screen right here.
所以我們將從這一個小的場景開始

381
00:19:39,895 --> 00:19:41,361
Which is gonna be our calculator.
搭建我們的計算器

382
00:19:41,363 --> 00:19:44,864
So let's start building our calculator with it's display.
我們先從搭建計算器的界面顯示開始

383
00:19:44,866 --> 00:19:45,999
So I wanna make a display.
當我想顯示一些東西時，

384
00:19:46,001 --> 00:19:47,917
So how do I do that?
我應該怎麼做呢？

385
00:19:47,918 --> 00:19:49,834
Well that brings us to the right side, the right-hand side here,
我們看一下這裡的右邊區域

386
00:19:49,837 --> 00:19:53,939
this whole right side, this is called the Utilities area
右邊的整塊區域，我們稱為 Utilities （工具）區域

387
00:19:53,941 --> 00:19:56,675
You can see that's it's got a bottom and a top, right?
你可以看到這裡有底部和頂部，對不？

388
00:19:56,677 --> 00:20:01,979
We want to go into the bottom and on the third tab right here, which is called
來到底部這裡的第三個按鈕，它被我們稱為

389
00:20:01,981 --> 00:20:07,818
the Object Library, you'll see that there's tons and tons of objects in here.
Object Library （對象庫），你可你看到這裡有非常多的對象

390
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,886
Okay, dozens of these things and
非常多的這類東西

391
00:20:09,888 --> 00:20:13,023
we're gonna get to a lot of these by the end of the quarter.
我們整個學期會接觸到很多這樣的東西

392
00:20:13,025 --> 00:20:15,992
But these are the things you build your user interface out of.
這些是用於搭建你的 UI 的

393
00:20:15,994 --> 00:20:19,362
So kind of towards the top, not all the way at the top, but towards the top,
靠近上面，但不完全靠近上面，就在這上面

394
00:20:19,364 --> 00:20:22,731
you'll start seeing things like buttons and text fields and things like that.
你會開始看到像按鈕，文本區域這樣的東西

395
00:20:22,733 --> 00:20:26,401
Well this is what we need obviously, to build our display here,
很明顯這是我們構建顯示區域所需要的東西

396
00:20:26,403 --> 00:20:28,536
is some sort of text field, and there's a couple of them here.
是某種顯示文本的區域，這裡有兩種

397
00:20:28,538 --> 00:20:32,140
One, this one called Label is static text, you see?
這一種稱為 Label 的是一種靜態的文本

398
00:20:32,142 --> 00:20:37,011
And this one Text Field is editable text, in other words you can touch on this one.
這種稱為 Text Field 是可編輯的文本，也就是說，你當你按下時

399
00:20:37,013 --> 00:20:39,846
And the little keyboard would slide up from the bottom and you could type in it.
鍵盤會從底部滑出來，所以你可以輸入文本

400
00:20:39,848 --> 00:20:43,600
So, the calculator, you can't really touch on the screen and start typing
因此對於計算器來說，你確實不能按下屏幕並且輸入，

401
00:20:43,604 --> 00:20:45,018
so we want this static text.
所以我們需要靜態的文本

402
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:48,721
So, I'm just going to pick this up with the mouse and drag it out.
所以我用鼠標把它拖出來

403
00:20:48,723 --> 00:20:50,990
Now, when I drag it out into my UI,
現在，當我把它拖入我的 UI 中時

404
00:20:50,991 --> 00:20:53,258
you're going to see a lot of little blue dash lines appearing.
你會看到很多藍色虛線出現

405
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,227
You see these?
看到沒？

406
00:20:55,228 --> 00:20:57,195
These are helping me put this in the right place.
這些可以幫助我們正確地擺放這些東西

407
00:20:57,197 --> 00:21:00,798
So, I can put it right in the center, for example, of my view.
比如說我可以把它放在視圖的中間

408
00:21:01,734 --> 00:21:04,335
I could put it up in a corner up here, which is what I'm gonna do.
我可以把它放在靠頂部這裡，我待會就準備這樣做

409
00:21:04,337 --> 00:21:05,669
Mm-kay.


410
00:21:05,671 --> 00:21:10,073
You always want your things that you put in your UI,
你總是會希望你放入 UI 中的東西

411
00:21:10,075 --> 00:21:14,643
as much as humanly possible, to be on one of these dashed blue lines.
盡可能地去利用這些藍色虛線

412
00:21:14,645 --> 00:21:18,097
And you'll understand why in a couple weeks when we starting talking about Auto Layout.
當你後面學習到 Auto Layout (自動佈局) 時就會明白為什麼這麼做了

414
00:21:18,098 --> 00:21:19,748
I'm gonna do a little Auto Layout right here just to kind of
我這裡將會涉及一點關於 Auto Layout 的東西，可以讓你

415
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,251
give you a feel for it.
對它有點感覺

416
00:21:21,252 --> 00:21:24,953
But those blue, dashed blue lines are gonna be your best friend when it comes to
不過，在你搭建用戶界面的時候，這些藍色虛線將會給你最大的幫助

417
00:21:24,955 --> 00:21:28,322
building your user interface and you'll quickly see why that is.
你會很快知道為什麼了

418
00:21:28,324 --> 00:21:30,691
Once you drag something out like this, you can,
每次你像這樣拖動東西，你可以

419
00:21:30,693 --> 00:21:34,061
these little things are rounded that show it's selected, right?
看到環繞在外面的東西，它表明瞭這個被選中了

420
00:21:34,063 --> 00:21:37,465
They also are little resize handles so you can grab them and resize them.
它們也可以用於調整大小，所以可以抓住它然後或者重新調整它們的大小

421
00:21:37,467 --> 00:21:42,235
When you resize it also re-puts those dashed blue lines out there, okay?
當你調整大小時，這些藍色虛線會重新排成一列，看到沒？

422
00:21:42,237 --> 00:21:43,969
So you definitely wanna, even have,
所以當你調整大小時，你肯定想

423
00:21:43,971 --> 00:21:47,106
when you're resizing, get those things lining up.
把這些東西排成一列

424
00:21:47,108 --> 00:21:49,976
You can also manipulate it directly, just double-click on it.
你還可以直接編輯它，只需要雙擊一下

425
00:21:49,978 --> 00:21:54,145
like a calculator probably doesn't want to come up, this is gonna be initial state of this.
通常計算器的初始狀態不是這樣子

426
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:58,349
Doesn't want to come up saying Label, it probably wants 0 or
初始狀態上面不會顯示 Label，它可能會顯示 0

427
00:21:58,351 --> 00:22:01,318
something like that in it's display.
或類似的東西

428
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,354
There's also things you wanna set about this though or
另外還有一種，當你無法直接編輯這些

429
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:08,258
anything you drag in your UI that you just can't direct manipulate and
你拖到 UI 里的內容時，

430
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:12,261
that's what the top half of this Utilities windows is, is for, okay?
你可以使用右上方的 Utilities windows（工具窗口）

431
00:22:12,263 --> 00:22:13,829
So if you look at the top half here,
所以當你看上面這裡，

432
00:22:13,831 --> 00:22:17,065
there's a bunch of tabs across the top including something like this,
在頂部這裡有許多標籤，包括像這種

433
00:22:17,067 --> 00:22:20,035
the Size Inspector for setting the size of this thing.
用於設置尺寸的 Size Inspector（尺寸檢查器）

434
00:22:20,037 --> 00:22:24,305
And this tab right here, really important, this is the Attributes Inspector.
這個標籤，稱作 Attributes Inspector（屬性檢查器），非常重要

435
00:22:24,307 --> 00:22:27,908
And this is an object oriented inspector, depending on what you have selected.
這是一個面向對象的檢查器，當你選擇不同的東西時

436
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:30,611
You'll have different user interface here in the top.
用戶界面將會有所改變

437
00:22:30,613 --> 00:22:33,880
And this let's you edit attributes about what's selected.
通過它可以讓你修改選中的內容的屬性

438
00:22:33,882 --> 00:22:34,882
So, for example,
比如

439
00:22:34,883 --> 00:22:37,883
a calculator, the zero doesn't really want to be on the left, right?
計算器中這個 0 其實不是在左邊，對不？

440
00:22:37,886 --> 00:22:40,653
Calculators, the zero, the numbers are on the right and
這個 0 應該是在右邊

441
00:22:40,655 --> 00:22:43,589
they kind of grow out from the right.
這些數字就像是從右邊出現的

442
00:22:43,591 --> 00:22:47,426
And so we can easily fix that with this Alignment thing right here.
我們可以很輕鬆地使用這裡的 Alignment（校准）修改它

443
00:22:47,428 --> 00:22:50,595
So I'm gonna click this and you see the zero move over to the right.
我點擊這裡，你就可以看到 0 到了右邊

444
00:22:50,597 --> 00:22:52,130
And, and maybe I want a bigger font.
還有，也許我想要大點的字體

445
00:22:52,132 --> 00:22:53,231
You see the Font right here.
你可以看到這裡的 Font（字體）

446
00:22:53,233 --> 00:22:55,666
I can click on this, pick different fonts.
我可以點擊這裡，選擇不同的字體

447
00:22:55,668 --> 00:22:59,470
I'm gonna just move it up to like 32 point, it's a nice big font.
把它增大到 32 點，稍微大點的字體

448
00:22:59,472 --> 00:23:00,937
You can notice it kinda cuts off.
你可以看到內容有點被裁剪了

449
00:23:00,939 --> 00:23:02,572
I made it so big that it's too small.
字體放大後，因此這裡顯得太小

450
00:23:02,574 --> 00:23:06,976
So I can always just resize this larger to make that fit.
所以我可以重新調整大小，使它能夠適應字體的大小

451
00:23:08,479 --> 00:23:10,345
So this is how we build our user interface.
這就是我們搭建用戶界面的方式

452
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:14,949
It's very direct manipulation and very object oriented as you'll start to
非常直觀的操作，並且非常地面向對象

453
00:23:14,951 --> 00:23:17,451
see when we add different kinds of objects.
當你加入不同的對象時你就可以看到

454
00:23:17,453 --> 00:23:20,187
So, let's actually run this application, okay?
所以，讓我們真正地運行我們的應用吧

455
00:23:20,189 --> 00:23:22,956
We haven't done, built any calculaterness about it,
儘管我們還沒有完成任何關於計算的東西，

456
00:23:22,958 --> 00:23:25,992
but we have this one field, let's run it and see what it looks like.
不過可以讓我們運行一下看看是什麼效果

457
00:23:25,994 --> 00:23:27,226
So, how do you run things?
應該怎麼運行？

458
00:23:27,228 --> 00:23:29,562
Well, you see right here where it says, iPhone 6?
嗯，這裡你可以看到，iPhone 6？

459
00:23:29,564 --> 00:23:33,331
This actually is a selector that lets you say where you want to
這實際上是可以讓你選擇用什麼設備

460
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:35,166
run your application.
運行你的應用

461
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:38,636
So you can see you can run it on an iOS device if you have one connected,
如果當你連上了一個 iOS 設備時，你可以在 iOS 設備上運行，

462
00:23:38,638 --> 00:23:40,271
I don't have one connected currently.
現在我還沒有連接

463
00:23:41,273 --> 00:23:43,056
But you can do that.
不過你可以這樣做試試

464
00:23:43,057 --> 00:23:44,840
And we'll talk in a Friday section probably in a week or
我們將會在一到兩周後的週五的課上

465
00:23:44,843 --> 00:23:48,478
two about how to get your devices hooked up.
談論如何連接你的設備

466
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,948
But also there's these plethora of simulators here, iPhone 6,
不過這裡有很多模擬器， iPhone 6 、

467
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:56,552
6+, iPhone 5, iPhone 4s, iPad Airs.
6+、 iPhone 5、 iPhone 4s、 iPad Airs

468
00:23:56,554 --> 00:23:58,920
And you can pick one of these to run on and
你可以選擇其中的一個運行，

469
00:23:58,922 --> 00:24:02,490
it'll actually simulate that device right here on your computer.
它們實際上是在你的電腦上模擬那些設備

470
00:24:02,492 --> 00:24:05,827
So I'm gonna run on the iPhone 6.
這裡我將會運行在 iPhone 6 上

471
00:24:05,829 --> 00:24:08,729
Okay,I'm just gonna hit Play, see this Play button right here?
好了，我將要點擊 Play 按鈕，看到 Play 按鈕沒？

472
00:24:08,731 --> 00:24:11,498
That's how you simulate, so Play.
這就是使用模擬器的方式，點擊 Play

473
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,933
Now it's launching the simulator.
現在啓動模擬器

474
00:24:12,935 --> 00:24:14,601
It's a separate process.
它是一個單獨的程序

475
00:24:14,603 --> 00:24:16,169
And it's going to run our App in there.
我們的 App 將會運行在它裡面

476
00:24:16,171 --> 00:24:17,403
And there it is.
就是這樣

477
00:24:17,405 --> 00:24:18,737
Now you might say, whoop.
現在你可能會說，哇！

478
00:24:18,739 --> 00:24:19,905
Big white square.
這麼大的白色正方形

479
00:24:19,907 --> 00:24:21,339
Oh that's not so good.
看起來不怎麼好

480
00:24:21,341 --> 00:24:23,825
And the reason this is so
這是因為

481
00:24:23,826 --> 00:24:26,310
big is because the iPhone 6 has a very high resolution display on it.
iPhone 6 的高分辨率屏幕

482
00:24:26,312 --> 00:24:30,881
Okay, the retina display, and it's way higher resolution than my computer, okay?
這種視網膜屏幕，比我電腦上的分辨率大得多，對吧？

483
00:24:30,883 --> 00:24:35,151
So I actually have to scroll around, you see there's the top of it.
所以我不得不上下滾動，你可以看到它的頂部

484
00:24:35,153 --> 00:24:37,754
Scroll up and down to get to it all.
通過上下滾動可以看到整個區域

485
00:24:37,756 --> 00:24:42,558
Luckily if you go to Window, this is not in the simulator now, the iOS simulator.
如果我們前往 Window 選項，這個選項現在不在 iOS 模擬器

486
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:46,628
If you go to Window and Scale, you can scale it down to be smaller and
如果你點擊 Window 並且點擊 Scale， 你可以把它縮小，

487
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:47,762
then it'll fit.
然後它的大小就與屏幕的大小匹配了

488
00:24:47,764 --> 00:24:49,497
Okay, so if you have a low resolution screen,
因此，如果你有低分辨率的屏幕

489
00:24:49,499 --> 00:24:51,532
you're definitely gonna wanna use Window > Scale.
你可以點擊 Window > Scale

490
00:24:51,534 --> 00:24:54,368
Cmd+3 right there is another way to do it.
也可以實用快捷鍵 Cmd+3

491
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:55,154
Okay?
懂不？

492
00:24:55,155 --> 00:25:00,939
So here's our UI, but it doesn't look to good, okay, because where's this?
這就是我們的 UI，不過看起來不怎麼樣，因為這些在哪裡？

493
00:25:00,942 --> 00:25:05,011
We put this zero in there and it just never showed up, what did we do wrong?
我們把 0 放在那裡，卻從來都沒有出現，我們哪裡做錯了？

494
00:25:05,013 --> 00:25:08,781
Well we didn't really do anything wrong and that zero is actually there.
實際上我們沒有做錯，那個 0 實際上就在那裡

495
00:25:08,783 --> 00:25:11,750
It's just here. Let me line up these UI's, this is not
就在那，先讓我把它們排成一列，雖然沒有

496
00:25:11,752 --> 00:25:16,554
necessarily exactly the same scale but its appropriate, approximately the same scale,
完全相同的比例但也是近似的，近似相同的比例，

497
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:19,857
you can see that the zero is actually off screen, [NOISE] okay?
你可以看到那個 0 實際上在屏幕外面，看到不？

498
00:25:19,859 --> 00:25:24,028
So its there but you just can't see it because its over here off the screen.
所以實際上它存在不過你看不到它，因為它在屏幕外面

499
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:28,465
Okay, and that's a problem, but that's a problem we can fix.
這是一個問題，不過這個問題我們可以解決

500
00:25:28,467 --> 00:25:29,732
So let's go fix that problem.
來，我們開始解決這個問題吧

501
00:25:31,302 --> 00:25:32,534
Why is that thing off-screen?
為什麼它在屏幕外面？

502
00:25:32,536 --> 00:25:35,837
Well, look at this UI right here, okay?
好了，看到這個 UI 沒？

503
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:36,838
What shape is it?
它是什麼形狀的？

504
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,373
It's square.
它是正方形的

505
00:25:38,375 --> 00:25:40,908
Okay, no iOS device is square.
不過沒有任何 iOS 設備是正方形的

506
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:43,544
There's not a single square iOS device in the world.
世界上沒有任何一種正方形的 iOS 設備

507
00:25:43,546 --> 00:25:46,078
They're all, you know, tall and thin,
你知道的，它們都是高的，並且瘦的，

508
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,581
or, if you turn them sideways, then they're long and short.
或者如果把它們側身來看，它們都又長又短

509
00:25:48,583 --> 00:25:50,650
Or even like an iPad.
甚至包括 iPad

510
00:25:50,651 --> 00:25:52,718
You know the aspect ratio on an iPad is slightly different than an iPhone so
你知道 iPad 的縱橫比例和 iPhone 稍微有點不同

511
00:25:52,721 --> 00:25:55,588
their all slightly different, but none of them are square.
它們略有不同，但它們都不是正方形的

512
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:58,657
So why do we design our UI in a square?
那為什麼我們把 UI 設計為方的？

513
00:25:58,659 --> 00:26:03,762
Because the way you design iOS interfaces, you design them in this square and
因為你這種 iOS 界面的設計，是將內容放這個方形中

514
00:26:03,764 --> 00:26:09,033
you give everything inside the square rules, called constraints,
然後給所有的內容都添加規則，這些規則我們稱之為約束，

515
00:26:09,035 --> 00:26:12,236
about what happens to them when they get squished down.
是關於當它們被壓扁時應該發生什麼變化

516
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:15,505
Either squished down vertically, squished down horizontally,
不過是水平還是垂直的壓扁

517
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:18,508
depending on what kinda device their getting put on, okay?
取決於它們被放到哪種設備中，明白不？

518
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:22,912
So you put these rules in there, so, what does it look like to put these rules in?
所以你會在這裡加入這些規則，那當加入這樣規則後會怎樣？

519
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:25,115
Well again, it's all direct manipulation
同樣的，這些都是直觀的操作

520
00:26:25,117 --> 00:26:31,186
So I'm going to give some rules to this label right here to make it so that it knows
我將要對這裡的這個 Label 增加一些規則，使得它知道

521
00:26:31,188 --> 00:26:36,957
what to do when this square gets squished down in any direction for any device.
對於任何方向的任何設備被壓扁時應該如何顯示

522
00:26:36,959 --> 00:26:38,659
So, what do I want the rules to be?
那我希望這些規則是什麼樣的？

523
00:26:38,661 --> 00:26:42,162
Well, I always want this thing to use the whole width.
我總希望它可以使用全部的寬度

524
00:26:42,164 --> 00:26:44,931
However much width I have, I want it all.
不管我的寬度是多少，我都希望填滿這個寬度

525
00:26:44,933 --> 00:26:50,102
So I'm gonna pin this right edge to this edge, okay?
所以我要固定這個右邊緣到這個邊緣的距離，對吧？

526
00:26:50,104 --> 00:26:53,205
I'm gonna make it so all widths are pinned to each other.
我這樣做是因為所有寬度都會由另外一方決定

527
00:26:53,207 --> 00:26:55,007
And I do that with the Ctrl key.
我使用 Ctrl 鍵來完成

528
00:26:55,009 --> 00:26:57,559
I've turned on sticky keys so
我已經開啓粘滯鍵所以

529
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,110
you can see down in the lower left here, it's showing the modifier keys I'm using.
在左下角你可以看到，它顯示了我正使用的按鍵

530
00:27:00,113 --> 00:27:02,213
So right now I'm holding down Ctrl.
現在我按住 Ctrl

531
00:27:02,215 --> 00:27:08,485
And I'm gonna Ctrl+drag from the right edge of this to the container it's in.
我按住 Ctrl，同時從右邊拖動到它的容器的右邊

532
00:27:08,487 --> 00:27:11,822
See how it's showing me what I'm dragged to.
看它是如何展示我正在拖動的過程

533
00:27:11,824 --> 00:27:15,125
So when I drag to this container, it puts a menu up and says,
當我拖到這個容器時，彈出了一個菜單，上面說，

534
00:27:15,127 --> 00:27:20,830
oh, okay, you want some rule between that label's right edge and
好吧，你想在標籤的右邊緣和當前邊緣之間增加一些規則

535
00:27:20,832 --> 00:27:23,999
this thing's edge, what do you want it to be?
你希望是怎麼樣的規則？

536
00:27:24,001 --> 00:27:26,568
Well, I can do a lot of things here.
恩，我可以做很多事情

537
00:27:26,569 --> 00:27:29,136
I could center this label vertically in this container.
我可以使這個標籤垂直居中於這個容器

538
00:27:29,139 --> 00:27:31,590
Up, you know, vertical up and down.
向上，你知道的，垂直向上和向下

539
00:27:31,591 --> 00:27:34,042
I definitely don't want that, I want my label at the top, so I don't want that.
我絕對不希望出現這種情況，我是希望我的 Label 在頂部

540
00:27:34,044 --> 00:27:34,776
I can make it the equal width,
我可以使它的寬度相等，

541
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:38,479
So I can make this label the same width as the container.
所以我可以使這個 Label 和容器的寬度相同

542
00:27:38,481 --> 00:27:42,049
I don't want that either, cuz I want this little margin there, right?
我也不想那種情況，因為我想設置這個小的邊距，對不對？

543
00:27:42,051 --> 00:27:45,785
But look at the top one, trailing space to container margin.
不過看上面的那個，trailing space to container margin（距離容器的右間距）

544
00:27:45,787 --> 00:27:51,157
This lets me pin the trailing space after my label to the margin of the container.
這讓我規定了我的 Label 尾部與它的容器的間距

545
00:27:51,159 --> 00:27:55,194
So that's the one I want, so I'm gonna click on this and it does it.
這就時我需要的，我點擊這個來完成

546
00:27:55,196 --> 00:27:59,664
Now, see all these yellow and orange lines that appeared when I did that?
現在，當我這樣做後，看到這些黃色和橙色的線條出現沒？

547
00:27:59,666 --> 00:28:04,401
That's because the systems like, okay, you've started telling me the rules for this label,
這就像是系統在說，嗯，
你已經開始告訴我應該遵循對這個標籤的某些規則，

548
00:28:04,403 --> 00:28:06,504
but your you haven't told me enough rules,
不過你沒有告訴我足夠多的規則

549
00:28:06,506 --> 00:28:08,005
I don't know what to do with this thing.
我不知道應該對它怎麼做，

550
00:28:08,007 --> 00:28:11,141
So now it's showing you all the places where it's like the system's not
所以現在提示你，當它被擠壓的時候

551
00:28:11,143 --> 00:28:13,310
sure what to do now when this thing gets squished.
系統不確定應該怎麼做

552
00:28:13,312 --> 00:28:15,745
Before it was like, okay, well you weren't telling me anything so
在這之前，你沒有告訴我任何規則

553
00:28:15,747 --> 00:28:18,081
I'm not going to do anything, but now your starting to tell me.
所以我沒有顯示任何東西，不過現在你開始告訴我

554
00:28:18,083 --> 00:28:19,648
So what do I do?
所以我應該怎麼做？

555
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:24,353
So we have to fully specify both the what happens horizontally and
所以我們不得不完整地告訴它水平方向

556
00:28:24,355 --> 00:28:25,520
vertically to this thing.
和垂直方向應該怎麼顯示

557
00:28:25,522 --> 00:28:27,422
So we've only just started here.
所以我們只是先從這裡開始

558
00:28:27,424 --> 00:28:31,225
So let's pin this edge also cuz we want this edge to stay on this side.
讓我們拖動固定這個邊緣，我們希望這個邊緣靠近這一邊

559
00:28:31,227 --> 00:28:34,528
So I'm gonna hold down Ctrl and drag.
所以我按下 Ctrl 並且拖動

560
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:38,965
And now I'm gonna pin the leading space to the container margin.
然後現在我想固定 Label 前部到容器之間的間距

561
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:41,100
Okay, boom that did that.
好了，我成功了

562
00:28:41,102 --> 00:28:44,670
Still have orange going on here, that's because I haven't specified anything about
這裡仍然顯示橙色，這是因為我還沒指定任何關於

563
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:49,675
the vertical position of this label so I'm gonna pin the top to the top, so
這個 Label 的垂直方向的規則，所以我把 Label 的頂部和容器頂部間距固定起來，

564
00:28:49,677 --> 00:28:54,212
hold Ctrl again, drag up here, this is now top space.
所以我又一次按住 Ctrl，拖到這裡，這是頂部間距

565
00:28:54,214 --> 00:28:58,882
Notice that it realizes where I am dragging to and from, right?
注意到它識別出我正把它拖向哪裡沒？

566
00:28:58,884 --> 00:29:00,984
So they can give me options that make sense,
所以它能給我有意義的選項，

567
00:29:00,986 --> 00:29:03,186
like Top Space to Layout Guide here.
比如這裡的 Top Space to Layout Guide(頂部間距)

568
00:29:03,188 --> 00:29:04,921
So I'm going to do that.
所以我會選這個

569
00:29:04,923 --> 00:29:06,489
So now I'm starting to get blue lines.
所以我開始看到藍色的線了

570
00:29:06,491 --> 00:29:07,489
You see these lines?
看到沒？

571
00:29:07,491 --> 00:29:08,657
I hope you can see that there.
希望你能看到

572
00:29:08,659 --> 00:29:11,493
They're solid blue, not orange or red.
它們是實心藍線，不是橙色或紅色

573
00:29:11,495 --> 00:29:16,230
Okay, that's because they're okay, we are okay horizontally here.
這是因為它們可以了，水平方向上沒問題了

574
00:29:16,232 --> 00:29:18,332
But we still have a problem vertically.
不過這裡仍然有一個垂直方向上的問題

575
00:29:18,334 --> 00:29:21,335
Now I'm not sure exactly what the problem is vertically cuz I really don't
現在我不是非常確定這個垂直方向上的問題因為我確實不

576
00:29:21,337 --> 00:29:23,536
want the bottom of this.
希望這樣的底部

577
00:29:23,538 --> 00:29:27,773
I just want it to hang out wherever it wants to hang out based on the size of my
我只是希望這個剛剛擺放的 Label 的底部是基於我的

578
00:29:27,775 --> 00:29:29,041
font or whatever.
字體大小之類的

579
00:29:29,043 --> 00:29:31,610
So I don't, I don't really wanna specify anything here so
因此，我確實不想在這裡指明特定的高度

580
00:29:31,612 --> 00:29:34,212
why is this orange and how do I get rid of this?
所以為什麼橙色警告會出現，我應該怎樣避免它？

581
00:29:34,214 --> 00:29:37,648
Well any time you have orange and when you're doing this layout stuff and
任何時候當你在佈局時看到橙色警告

582
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:38,949
you don't know what to do.
你不知道應該怎樣做的時候

583
00:29:38,951 --> 00:29:41,885
You wanna go down to this button right here, okay?
你可以點擊下面的這個按鈕，看到不？

584
00:29:41,887 --> 00:29:44,905
This is the document outline.
這是 document outline(文檔大綱)

585
00:29:44,906 --> 00:29:47,924
And when you click this, a little thing will slide out, a little shelf here.
當你點擊這裡時，這部分會滑出來，一個小架子

586
00:29:47,926 --> 00:29:53,095
And this is an outline view of everything that's in your UI.
這是你的 UI 中所有內容的大綱

587
00:29:53,097 --> 00:29:53,897
Okay? And they're linked,
並且它們之間是相互關聯的，

588
00:29:53,899 --> 00:29:58,000
So if I click the background, nothing is selected.
如果我點擊背景，沒有選中任何內容

589
00:29:58,002 --> 00:30:00,769
Then the background, the view is what's selected here.
然後這個背景，這個視圖就是我這裡選擇的

590
00:30:00,771 --> 00:30:04,605
But if I click this L0, which means a label with zero in it,
但當我點擊這裡 L0 標籤時，L0 指的是 Label 中顯示內容是 0，

591
00:30:04,607 --> 00:30:06,240
look it's selected my Zero label,
看我被選中的 Label，

592
00:31:06,242 --> 00:30:10,143
And vice versa if I click on this here, it selects it over here.
選中，反之亦然如果我點擊這裡，這裡顯示被選中

593
00:30:10,145 --> 00:30:14,380
So this is this same thing in an outline mode.
所以這和大綱模式一樣

594
00:30:14,382 --> 00:30:16,349
This is really nice to have.
這是一種非常好的方式

595
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:18,317
Sometimes you have views that are overlapping and they're kind of in
有時候你的視圖重疊在一起，所以它們顯得有點

596
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:22,421
each other's way, you can always go here to select the one you want, okay?
難以選擇，你可以來到這裡選擇你想選擇的視圖

597
00:30:22,423 --> 00:30:27,525
And you can Ctrl+drag to these over here too it's just as much Ctrl+draggable as
並且你也可以在這裡 Ctrl + 拖動，這裡和其它東西

598
00:30:27,527 --> 00:30:30,294
some of these other things.
一樣可 Ctrl + 拖動

599
00:30:30,296 --> 00:30:32,513
But what we're, and we'll look,
但這些我們將會

600
00:30:32,514 --> 00:30:34,731
We'll talk about top layout guide, bottom layout guide a little later.
我們將討論一下頂部和底部的佈局指南

601
00:30:34,734 --> 00:30:38,369
But what I really want you to focus on is this little yellow circle up here.
但是我想讓你注意這個黃色的小圓圈

602
00:30:38,371 --> 00:30:39,870
'Kay? Any time you got yellow and
好的，任何時候，你在使用 Auto-layout 中

603
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:42,172
orange problems with this auto-layout business,
看到黃色和橙色的線

604
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:45,108
you're gonna get this little yellow circle appearing in your document outline.
你可以在你的 document outline 中看到這個小黃圈

605
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:50,479
And if you click it, it'll slide in a list of all the problems.
如果你點擊它，它會滑入一個列表，列出所有的問題

606
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:54,349
And so here I highlight over this and this is where all the orange and yellow is.
如果選中它，出現高亮的部分就是警告所出現的地方

607
00:30:54,351 --> 00:30:59,487
It's saying the label with the 0 in it expected the height to be 39 but
它提示這個顯示 0 的 label 的高度應該是 39，但

608
00:30:59,489 --> 00:31:00,955
the actual height is 57.
真實的情況卻是 57

609
00:31:00,957 --> 00:31:03,824
Well that's because after I set this font,
這是因為我在設置了這個字體後，

610
00:31:03,826 --> 00:31:06,460
I just dragged this down a little bit to make space.
我向下的拖動了一部分，讓它多出來一些空間

611
00:31:06,462 --> 00:31:09,262
All right, I, I wasn't very, I, I didn't know it was supposed to be 39.
我不是很清楚它的高度是否應該 39

612
00:31:09,264 --> 00:31:11,330
I just dragged down.
我只是稍稍向下拖動了而已

613
00:31:11,332 --> 00:31:14,283
And so it's saying that's wrong.
這樣，Xcode 給了我一個警告

614
00:31:14,284 --> 00:31:17,235
Now, I could just try drag it back up and meet this dashed line.
現在，我可以試著將其拖動，和這個虛線重疊

615
00:31:17,238 --> 00:31:19,738
This dashed line, by the way,
強調下這條虛線，

616
00:31:19,739 --> 00:31:22,239
is where it's kind of saying, this is really where this thing wants to be.
它好像就在表明，這個東西想要出現在這裡

617
00:31:22,242 --> 00:31:24,642
But the solid lines are where it actually is.
但是實線是它真實存在的地方

618
00:31:24,644 --> 00:31:31,749
So I could kinda drag it up to there, but I, I could be off by a pixel or something else.
所以我可以把它拖動到那裡，但是我也許會相差 1 個像素或有些其它差別

620
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:34,184
A much more reliable way is to click this little yellow triangle, 'kay?
現在有一個可靠的方法，點擊這個黃色小三角

621
00:31:34,186 --> 00:31:36,186
So I'm gonna click this yellow triangle.
我將要點擊這個

622
00:31:36,188 --> 00:31:37,854
It's gonna bring up this pop-up window.
它會彈出一個窗口

623
00:31:37,856 --> 00:31:42,091
And there's three ways to fix the problems, okay?
這裡給出了三個修改問題的方法

624
00:31:42,093 --> 00:31:45,327
One way, Update Constraints, this middle way right here.
其中一個，Update Constraints，在中間

625
00:31:45,329 --> 00:31:49,098
That's a way that says, hey, I want this thing to be,
這個方法是，我想要這樣做

626
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,199
this label to be right where it is.
我想讓這個 label 出現在它該出現的位置

627
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:52,967
So just make some constraints.
所以只要做一些約束

628
00:31:52,969 --> 00:31:53,634
Make it up.
彌補上這個缺點

629
00:31:53,636 --> 00:31:56,237
Make it happen!
發生吧！

630
00:31:56,238 --> 00:31:58,839
And it'll put some wacky constraints in there like 52 high, which is a bad
它會添加一些古怪的約束，例如把高度設置為 52

631
00:31:58,841 --> 00:32:02,309
constraint for it to be, 52 high, cuz this label wants to be its natural height.
這不是我想要的約束，因為 52 的高度不是這個 label 本來的高度

632
00:32:02,311 --> 00:32:04,378
It doesn't want to be 52 high.
它的不想變成 52 這麼高

633
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,346
So this'll kinda force constraint.
所以這裡就像是強制性的約束

634
00:32:06,348 --> 00:32:08,614
You'll almost never want this one, 'kay.
你幾乎永遠不會用到這一項

635
00:32:08,616 --> 00:32:11,250
Rarely do you wanna force the constraints.
你很少需要強制性地去約束

636
00:32:11,252 --> 00:32:14,520
Reset to Suggested Constraints would probably just work here.
Reset to Suggested Constraints 也許會在這裡起作用

637
00:32:14,522 --> 00:32:16,788
I'm not gonna choose this one, but it would probably work.
我不會選擇這個，但是它可能會起作用

638
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:21,125
This one is going to make the constraints match the blue lines.
這個可以把 label 的約束與藍線重合

639
00:32:21,127 --> 00:32:24,762
Those dashed blue lines that I told you always wanna meet.
我告訴過你那些藍線，是需要必須重疊的

640
00:32:24,764 --> 00:32:28,899
Those are what's gonna help the system pick suggested constraints.
那些是能夠幫助系統選擇建議的約束

641
00:32:28,901 --> 00:32:32,769
So since we dragged that label out to the blue lines perfectly,
如果我們把 label 拖動到藍線的位置

642
00:32:32,771 --> 00:32:36,639
I'll bet if I said Reset to Suggested Constraints, it might just work.
Reset to Suggested Constraints 也是會起作用的

643
00:32:36,641 --> 00:32:38,941
Okay. But I'm actually gonna show you this
但是我想給你們展示頂部的這一項

644
00:32:38,943 --> 00:32:43,646
last option up on top, which is Update Frame and what this says is, take into
Update Frame，這個能夠根據已經設定的約束，

645
00:32:43,648 --> 00:32:49,918
consideration all the rules and move this label to where the rules say it should be.
把 label 移動到該放置的位置

646
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,187
'Kay.And I like this option a lot because it
我比較喜歡這個選項

647
00:32:52,189 --> 00:32:55,523
lets you kind of preview, do I have my little rules right, okay?
它讓你能夠預覽，我的約束是否設置正確了

648
00:32:55,525 --> 00:32:59,860
So let's try that, let's see if the, we'll tell the, move this label, go ahead and
我們嘗試一下，label 是否能夠按照已有的約束，移動到

649
00:32:59,862 --> 00:33:03,564
move yourself and size yourself to obey these three rules we you put in, and
它該去的地方並且設置好自己應有的大小

650
00:33:03,566 --> 00:33:06,066
we'll fix the misplacement, so let's try it.
我們點擊這個按鈕，讓我們嘗試下

651
00:33:07,069 --> 00:33:10,269
And sure enough it did it, it says there are no Auto Layout issues.
果然做到了，沒有任何問題

652
00:33:10,271 --> 00:33:14,940
If I go back to my document outline, this little yellow circle is gone.
如果回到 document outline，這個黃色的小圓圈已經消失了

653
00:33:14,942 --> 00:33:18,810
If I look in my view, everything is blue-lined, no yellow or red.
看看自己的視圖，全部都是藍線，沒有紅色或黃色的

654
00:33:20,146 --> 00:33:22,630
Okay? So that's your
好了嗎？這就說明你的

655
00:33:22,631 --> 00:33:25,115
crash course on Auto Layout, and we're gonna talk a lot more about Auto Layout,
Auto Layout 已經完成，我們接下來討論更多 Auto Layout

656
00:33:25,118 --> 00:33:28,719
in fact, even on Wednesday I'm gonna do another Auto Layout with all the buttons.
在週三的課上，我會對所有的按鈕做一下 Auto Layout

657
00:33:28,721 --> 00:33:30,671
Right? The keypad buttons, and
計算器的所有按鈕

658
00:33:30,672 --> 00:33:32,622
all that, which is a lot more things being laid out.
這聽起來真的蠻多的

659
00:33:32,624 --> 00:33:34,224
But let's see if this fixes our problem.
看看是否修復了問題

660
00:33:34,226 --> 00:33:37,527
Let's go ahead and run our application again.
我們再次運行一下應用

661
00:33:37,529 --> 00:33:39,795
So I'm just hitting that play button.
點擊這個運行按鈕

662
00:33:39,797 --> 00:33:41,563
 Here it, oh, we got our zero this time.
此刻，我們可以看到這個 0 了

663
00:33:41,565 --> 00:33:45,334
You see how it pinned this zero to that edge?
你注意到這個 0 固定在邊緣了嗎?

664
00:33:45,336 --> 00:33:48,036
And not only that, if we rotate this phoned,
不僅可以這樣，如果我們旋轉模擬器，

665
00:33:48,038 --> 00:33:52,273
which you can do in the Simulators menu, Hardware > Rotate.
你可以在模擬器的菜單中點擊 Hardware > Rotate

666
00:33:53,976 --> 00:33:58,378
Look the 0, this got wider and the 0 kept pin, pinning itself over to that.
看看這個 0，它變得更寬，0 還是把自己固定在邊緣

667
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:01,981
And it also stayed on the top even though this got, whole thing got shorter.
它也保持著距離頂部的距離，即使它變窄了一些

668
00:34:01,983 --> 00:34:04,884
Okay. And if I rotate back, the 0 stays there.
接下來，如果我旋轉回來，0 還是保持原樣

669
00:34:04,886 --> 00:34:07,420
Question. So what did it do at the bottom there?
學生提問：底部發生了什麼？

670
00:34:07,422 --> 00:34:10,422
Like what did the actual update frame end up doing?
Update Frame 到底做了什麼事情？

671
00:34:10,424 --> 00:34:12,758
What did the update frame in the document outline do?
Document Outline 中的 Update Frame 到底做了什麼事情？

672
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,693
Yes. It moved this bottom edge up.
它移動了底部的邊緣

673
00:34:14,695 --> 00:34:17,462
You see this is only 39 pixels high now.
你看現在是 39 的像素高度

674
00:34:17,464 --> 00:34:18,396
It was 52.
之前它是 52

675
00:34:18,397 --> 00:34:19,329
So, yeah, it just moved it up.
這樣，它發生了改變，向上移動了

676
00:34:19,332 --> 00:34:21,665
It, it, and if other things had been yellow,
如果還有其他部分有黃色線，

677
00:34:21,667 --> 00:34:23,133
it could have moved the whole thing.
它可能就會移動整個 label

678
00:34:23,135 --> 00:34:24,718
Right? It would move that
好的，它將移動這個 label

679
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,302
whole rectangle wherever the rule said but
來實現約束但是

680
00:34:26,304 --> 00:34:29,539
in this case, you can fix that one problem by moving it up.
這種情況，你可以通過向上拖動來修復這個問題

681
00:34:29,541 --> 00:34:30,139
Good question.
問得不錯

682
00:34:31,342 --> 00:34:33,541
Okay? So that's good.
還不錯

684
00:34:33,543 --> 00:34:34,976
All right.

685
00:34:34,977 --> 00:34:36,410
So that's it for Auto Layout.
這就是 Auto Layout

686
00:34:36,413 --> 00:34:38,346
Auto Layout part one.
Auto Layout 第一部分

687
00:34:38,348 --> 00:34:43,016
So now let's talk a little bit about connecting our user interface that we're
現在我們來說一下如何將 UI

688
00:34:43,018 --> 00:34:45,385
building right here, up to the code,
和代碼建立起聯繫

689
00:34:45,387 --> 00:34:48,254
cuz we want that code to be able to talk to the user interface.
因為我們想讓代碼和 UI 進行交流

690
00:34:48,256 --> 00:34:51,157
Otherwise how are we gonna have the number buttons,
否則我們如何能夠使數字按鈕產生的數字

691
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:53,425
make numbers appear up here in the display?
顯示在頂部的 label 里

692
00:34:53,427 --> 00:34:56,795
Or the times button, give the results of the calculation up here.
或者按下乘法按鈕，就會把結果顯示在這裡

693
00:34:56,797 --> 00:34:58,363
We gotta be able to talk to this.
我們需要這樣的交流

694
00:34:58,365 --> 00:35:01,633
So how do we do that?
但是如何做到呢？

695
00:35:01,634 --> 00:35:04,902
And the answer, first step is, we need to get both this co, this Swift Code,
第一步，我們要把 view 和 controller 中的 Swift 代碼

696
00:35:04,904 --> 00:35:10,440
the controller, and this view on screen at the same time, 'kay?
同時顯示在屏幕上

697
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:12,742
Cuz we're gonna connect them so we need them on screen at the same time,
因為我們會連接它們，所以我們需要它們同時顯示在屏幕上

698
00:35:12,744 --> 00:35:17,180
and there's a lot of ways to do that, but I'll do the simplest way right here,
我將用最簡單的方式實現這個

699
00:35:17,182 --> 00:35:20,616
which is this little button called the assistant editor, all right?
使用 Assistant Editor 這個按鈕

700
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:22,184
So I'm gonna click that and look!
我要點了，看看會發生什麼

701
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:25,120
It put them both on screen at the same time, exactly what I wanted.
它把它們同時放上屏幕，這正是我想要的

702
00:35:25,122 --> 00:35:27,355
Now it's all a little crowded here.
現在這裡有一點擁擠

703
00:35:27,357 --> 00:35:31,892
Even if I expand my view a little bit, it's like it's all smashed in here.
即使我放大整個界面，它看起來還是這麼小

704
00:35:31,894 --> 00:35:35,696
Luckily the navigator and the utilities can also be hidden,
幸運的是 Navigator 和 Utilities 這些都是可以隱藏起來的，

705
00:35:35,698 --> 00:35:37,931
see these buttons up here, these three buttons?
這裡有三個按鈕

706
00:35:37,933 --> 00:35:40,734
This left one, if you click it hides the navigator and
左側這個，如果你點擊它會隱藏 Navigator

707
00:35:40,736 --> 00:35:45,504
this right one if you click it hides utilities, 'kay?
點擊右側這個，會隱藏右側的 Utilities

708
00:35:45,506 --> 00:35:50,308
So now we have both my UI and over here we can still double click to zoom out, but
現在它們都在我們的視線中，我可以雙擊縮放它

709
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:54,646
the thing is, anytime we're actually connecting our UI to our code or
但是我們在想要連接代碼和 UI 或者

710
00:35:54,648 --> 00:35:59,183
trying to edit anything in here,you need to be zoomed to normal, 'kay?
嘗試去編輯的時候，你需要把縮放比例調到正常

711
00:35:59,185 --> 00:36:02,353
For example if I tried to select if I'm zoomed out and
例如這個，如果我縮小

712
00:36:02,355 --> 00:36:04,955
I try to select this 0 I just can't.
我就不能選中這個 0 了

713
00:36:04,957 --> 00:36:08,891
This is really kind of a bird's eye view just for seeing what your UI looks like.
這個其實只是一個預覽圖模式，讓你看看大體樣子，而不能編輯

714
00:36:08,893 --> 00:36:10,726
If you wanna actually work on it,
如果你想要編輯

715
00:36:10,727 --> 00:36:12,560
you double-click to zoom in on this scene that you're interested in.
雙擊你需要編輯的窗口就可以了

716
00:36:14,064 --> 00:36:15,630
Okay, so here's our Swift code.
這是我們的 Swift 代碼

717
00:36:15,632 --> 00:36:17,598
I'm actually gonna delete these.
我將要刪除這些

718
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,635
We don't need them for the calculator.
在我們的應用中是不需要這些的

719
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:24,338
We will need these things for future application but we don't need it for the calculator.
我們會在將來的應用需要這些，但在這裡不需要

721
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:27,974
And this is your first look at Swift, 'kay.
這是你第一次看到 Swift 代碼

722
00:36:27,976 --> 00:36:31,711
So Swift, as I said, very concise language, but it's basically an object
Swift 是非常簡潔的、

723
00:36:31,713 --> 00:36:36,048
oriented language, it's gonna look a lot like C, some things look a lot like Java.
面向對象的語言，它看起來像 C，有些東西像 Java

724
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:40,385
It's kind of the, you know, best of, of a lot of different worlds at once.
它集眾多語言之長

725
00:36:40,387 --> 00:36:44,823
Now this import is just importing the UI portion of iOS.
這句 import 導入了 iOS 的 UI 部分

726
00:36:44,825 --> 00:36:47,658
You usually won't have to specify import yourself unless you start
除非你需要使用一些框架，

727
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:52,496
using frameworks that are not, you know, the base frameworks and we'll get to that
通常來說不需要自己導入，我們幾周後會講到那裡

728
00:36:52,498 --> 00:36:56,233
probably weeks into the quarter where you fi, finally have to do an import yourself.
最後你還是得自己導入

729
00:36:56,235 --> 00:36:58,601
So this how it automatically got put here for us.
這裡我們看到它自動的為我們添加了

730
00:36:58,603 --> 00:37:02,838
And so this is really your first line of Swift code, 'kay?
在這是你的第一行 Swift 代碼

731
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:06,975
Appropriately, it's a definition of a class.
這裡是定義了一個類

732
00:37:06,977 --> 00:37:10,479
Cuz Swift is fundamentally object-oriented and here we're defining a class.
因為 Swift 是以面向對象為基礎的，這裡是定義的一個類

733
00:37:10,481 --> 00:37:13,448
So what does the syntax look like to define a class?
定義一個類的語法是什麼樣的？

734
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:15,416
You got the keyword class.
你得使用關鍵字 class

735
00:37:15,418 --> 00:37:16,817
You got the name of the class.
這裡是這個類的名稱

736
00:37:16,819 --> 00:37:20,654
Now this name ViewController, pretty bad name,
現在這個名字 ViewController 看起來很糟糕

737
00:37:20,656 --> 00:37:23,523
Okay, very generic, really they should probably be something like
非常普通的名字，它應該起名為例如

738
00:37:23,525 --> 00:37:26,593
CalculatorViewController,something specific to
CalculatorViewController 這樣有針對的名字，

739
00:37:26,595 --> 00:37:33,599
this particular scene that we're orking on right here, that it's controlling.
這樣看起來就讓人清楚它是控制哪裡的了

740
00:37:33,601 --> 00:37:35,668
This is the default name it gives you.
這是個默認的名字

741
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:38,337
I don't want to spend the valuable demo time showing how to
我不想花費寶貴的時間去演示如何

742
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,656
rename this cuz unfortunately,
重命名，因為

743
00:37:40,657 --> 00:37:42,974
I can't just type a new name here because I gotta keep the UI in sync with it.
我不能在這裡輸入一個新名字, 因為我要保持 UI 與之同步

744
00:37:42,976 --> 00:37:45,276
So I would have to do something in the UI as well.
所以我必須在 UI 中做一些事情

745
00:37:45,278 --> 00:37:48,079
But, for now, for your first assignment or two we're, we'll just
你的第一次或第二次作業，我們只會

746
00:37:48,081 --> 00:37:51,548
call this ViewController, but down the road you're gonna wanna pick better names.
叫它 ViewController，但在這之後，你最好給他更換一個好的名字

747
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:54,251
And of course you're gonna be building multiple of
當然你將會在這個應用的這個類中

748
00:37:54,253 --> 00:37:57,554
these scenes in this class in the same app in the future, so
創建多個場景

749
00:37:57,556 --> 00:38:01,024
of course, they'll all have different controller names.
當然它們每一個都有不同的 controller 名稱

750
00:38:01,026 --> 00:38:07,796
Okay, this :UIViewController, that's inheritance, that's its superclass, okay?
這個 ':UIViewController' 是告訴我們它的父類是誰

751
00:38:08,799 --> 00:38:12,334
Swift is single inheritance, so you can only inherit from one class.
Swift 是單繼承，你只能讓它繼承一個類

752
00:38:12,336 --> 00:38:18,139
It's perfectly fine in Swift not to inherit from a class if you don't want to, all right?
在 Swift 中，你不想繼承也可以

754
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:20,140
But here we have to inherit from UIViewController cuz we
但在這裡我們必須繼承於 UIViewController

755
00:38:20,142 --> 00:38:23,176
want all this magic that allows us to control the UI,
想通過它來控制 UI，

756
00:38:23,178 --> 00:38:27,880
like that whole Auto Layout business, and there's a ton of mechanism in here for
像 Auto Layout，這有很多種方式來讓

757
00:38:27,882 --> 00:38:31,083
the, the allowing the controller to control this UI.
controller 控制 UI

758
00:38:31,085 --> 00:38:35,487
So obviously we do that so all ViewControllers, all controllers of these
很明顯，所有 ViewController, 所有這些場景中的 controller

759
00:38:35,489 --> 00:38:40,425
little scenes always inherit from either from UIViewController directly or they
必須直接繼承於 UIViewController，或者繼承於繼承 UIViewController 的子類

760
00:38:40,427 --> 00:38:45,296
inherit from a class that inherits from UIViewController or up their chain so.
或者在繼承鏈條上

761
00:38:46,399 --> 00:38:51,134
And then inside this curly brace is simply all the instance variables and
在這個花括號里是所有的實例變量和

762
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:54,070
methods in this class, 'kay?
方法

763
00:38:54,072 --> 00:38:58,207
So very simple syntax to define a class.
定義類的語法是非常簡練的

764
00:38:58,209 --> 00:39:02,144
So let's dive right into making some instance variables and methods so
所以讓我們定義一些實例變量和方法

765
00:39:02,146 --> 00:39:03,912
you can see what those look like.
來看看語法是什麼樣的

766
00:39:03,914 --> 00:39:09,216
And I thought we, this was segued to because we're going to
我們要把這個

767
00:39:09,218 --> 00:39:12,953
say we wanted to connect this UI to this code.
這個 UI 對象連接到代碼中

768
00:39:12,955 --> 00:39:15,072
So let's do that.
我們現在就這樣做

769
00:39:15,073 --> 00:39:17,190
Let's connect this label right here into this code, and
我們連接這個 label 到代碼中去，

770
00:39:17,192 --> 00:39:20,560
then we're gonna do that by  making an instance variable.
然後我們會創建一個實例變量

771
00:39:20,562 --> 00:39:23,062
In Swift we call them properties.
在 Swift 中我們叫它們 properties

772
00:39:23,064 --> 00:39:25,330
'Kay so if you hear me say property,
如果你聽到我說 property，

773
00:39:25,332 --> 00:39:27,165
I'm basically talking about an instance variable.
那我其實就是在說實例變量

774
00:39:27,167 --> 00:39:29,467
Right? A variable that is part of the class.
清楚嗎？實例變量是類中的一個變量

775
00:39:29,469 --> 00:39:31,869
Every instance of the class gets its own copy of it.
類的每個實例都有它自己的拷貝

776
00:39:31,871 --> 00:39:34,171
Hopefully you all know what an instance variable is.
希望你們都知道什麼是實例變量

777
00:39:34,173 --> 00:39:35,739
If you don't, again, this class,
如果你不清楚，再說一次，這門課程

778
00:39:35,741 --> 00:39:38,408
heavy object-oriented, you should definitely know that.
需要很強的面向對象功底，你們應當很清楚

779
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:41,678
So I'm gonna make a property here, an instance variable,
我將要聲明一個 property ，也可以說是一個實例變量

780
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:45,848
that points to this label, so that I can update the label's text, right?
使用指針指向這個 label，這樣就我就能夠更新這個 label 的內容了

781
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:50,486
I need to be able to talk to this label, and the way you do that in eh,
我得跟這個 label 通信，方法是

782
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:55,824
in Xcode is you hold down Ctrl, just like we did when we were making
在 Xcode 中，按住 Ctrl，像剛才和邊緣連接那樣

783
00:39:55,826 --> 00:39:59,627
a connection to the edge, so I'm holding down Ctrl and clicking on the label, but
所以我按住 Ctrl，連接 label

784
00:39:59,629 --> 00:40:02,596
instead of going to the edge, I'm gonna go into the code, 'kay?
但這次是連接到代碼中去

785
00:40:02,598 --> 00:40:06,166
Now this is kinda wacky.
這是有點古怪

786
00:40:06,168 --> 00:40:07,901
I know a lot of you are like what?
我知道你們都會感覺很奇怪

787
00:40:07,903 --> 00:40:08,501
Into the code?
放到代碼里？

788
00:40:08,503 --> 00:40:11,004
Yeah?

789
00:40:11,005 --> 00:40:13,506
So we're going right into the code here and let go and it's gonna say oh,
現在我們到右邊代碼中，松開鼠標

790
00:40:13,508 --> 00:40:16,308
you wanna make a connection between your UI and your controller.
你想連接 UI 和 controller

791
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:18,844
No problem, what kinda connection you wanna make?
你需要哪種連接？

792
00:40:18,846 --> 00:40:20,846
And we wanna make what's called an outlet connection.
我們需要設置 outlet 連接

793
00:40:20,848 --> 00:40:22,681
An outlet means an instance variable or
outlet 代表指向 UI 的

794
00:40:22,683 --> 00:40:25,717
property that points to this thing in the UI.
實例變量或 property

795
00:40:25,719 --> 00:40:30,021
And all it needs to know to do that is, what do you wanna call this property?
接下來它需要知道 property 應該叫什麼名字

796
00:40:30,023 --> 00:40:34,925
And this is the display of my calculator so I'm gonna call this display and it
它將是我計算器的顯示部分，所以我將它命名為 display，

797
00:40:34,927 --> 00:40:38,962
already knows the type of the thing is UILabel of course cuz we dragged from here.
因為我們是從 label 拽過來的，所以知道它的類型

798
00:40:38,964 --> 00:40:41,431
Don't worry about this weak, I'll talk about that in a moment.
不要擔心這個 weak，在後面我們會講到

799
00:40:41,433 --> 00:40:45,067
And then we just hit Connect, and it creates an instance variable or
然後我們點擊 connect, 它會在 controller 中

800
00:40:45,069 --> 00:40:47,202
property, right here in our controller.
創建一個實例變量或 property

801
00:40:47,204 --> 00:40:51,339
So this is a great opportunity to look at the syntax in Swift for
這是一個很好的機會瞭解，在 Swift 中如何

802
00:40:51,341 --> 00:40:54,109
creating a property.
創建一個 property 的語法

803
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:56,878
And there's a couple of things on here that are not normally part of it.
這裡有幾件事情通常都不是它的一部分

804
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:02,516
This is you, the main syntax for creating a property.
這是你創建一個 property 的主要語法

805
00:41:02,518 --> 00:41:04,418
Let's quickly look at this thing to get it out of the way.
我們快速的瞭解下這個用法

806
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:07,454
This is not really part of the Swift language proper.
這不是 Swift 真正語言的一部分

807
00:41:07,456 --> 00:41:09,555
This is something Xcode puts in here so
這個小圓圈是 Xcode 生成的

808
00:41:09,557 --> 00:41:14,526
that this little circle, do you see the little circle in this gutter, appears?
這個小圓圈出現在這裡，你看到了嗎？

809
00:41:14,528 --> 00:41:18,463
This little circle when I mouse over it, look what Xcode does.
當我把鼠標移動到上面時候，看看 Xcode 的變化

810
00:41:18,465 --> 00:41:21,933
It shows me what this line of code is connected to.
它展示了這行代碼所連接到了什麼地方

811
00:41:21,935 --> 00:41:23,852
'Kay? So that's really cool, and
這看起來非常酷，

812
00:41:23,853 --> 00:41:25,770
you're gonna see that's really valuable later in this demo,
在這個 demo 中，這是非常有用的，

813
00:41:25,772 --> 00:41:27,838
is being able to find out what things are connected to.
它能找到我們連接的是什麼控件

814
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,773
So that's all this thing means here.
這個就是它在這裡所展示的意義

815
00:41:29,775 --> 00:41:33,777
You, you, you don't type this in yourself, that when you Ctrl+drag, it puts it there.
當你按下 Ctrl 同時點擊拖動時候，你（可能）不懂這裡出現的 Weak 的意思

816
00:41:33,779 --> 00:41:38,748
This weak, all you, you, if you come from other languages,
如果你從其他語言過來的

817
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:44,653
you're used to things like garbage collection to clean up the heap.
你會使用過類似的垃圾回收機制

818
00:41:44,655 --> 00:41:46,288
Or maybe you even have to alloc and
或者你也許在一些語言里習慣

819
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:50,258
free things yourself manually in some languages.
自己手動管理內存

820
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:51,792
None of that in Swift.
在 Swift 中是沒有的

821
00:41:51,794 --> 00:41:54,828
In Swift, the, all objects live in the heap, 'kay.
在 Swift 中，所有的對象都在堆中

822
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:58,398
All class, the instances of classes live in the heap.
所有類，類的實例都存在堆中

823
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:02,335
And the memory for them is managed for you, 'kay?
而 Swift 已經替你進行了內存管理

824
00:42:02,337 --> 00:42:05,371
You allocate them as much as you want, as soon as there's no pointers to them,
只要沒有了指針指向它們，你可以隨意分配它們內存

825
00:42:05,373 --> 00:42:08,274
they get cleaned up, and it's not garbage collection, 'kay?
它們會自動清理，但不是垃圾回收機制

826
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:10,493
It's reference counting.
這就是引用計數

827
00:42:10,494 --> 00:42:12,711
It's actually counting references to them but it's all automatic.
它實際上是計算引用它們的次數，但這都是自動的

828
00:42:12,713 --> 00:42:16,548
The only thing you ever have to be maybe interested in is this weak business which
你剛才也許唯一感興趣的是這個 weak 的作用

829
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:19,851
is less than a hundredth of a percent of the time.
這東西出現的次數不會太頻繁

830
00:42:19,853 --> 00:42:23,788
And for the first four weeks of this class, forget about weak.
前四周的課程中，忘掉這個 weak

831
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:27,591
It'll automatically happen when you do this Ctrl+drag, but just ignore it.
它會自動在你當你按下 Ctrl 同時拖動時候出現，但是先忽略它

832
00:42:27,593 --> 00:42:29,560
But the main thing to know is that all that memory
而最主要的事情是你要知道內存管理

833
00:42:29,562 --> 00:42:31,128
management is happening for you.
是如何發生的

834
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:34,330
Also this, instance variable right here,
同時，實例變量在這裡，

835
00:42:34,332 --> 00:42:38,267
which is a pointer to this object, notice there's no ampersands or
它是指向對象的指針，注意這裡沒有與符號 「&」 或者 「*」

836
00:42:38,269 --> 00:42:42,271
stars or any other kind of syntax that says this is a pointer.
或者其他任何語法說這是一個指針

837
00:42:42,273 --> 00:42:44,406
'Kay?

838
00:42:44,407 --> 00:42:46,540
If you have a instance, variable or property or
一個實例，變量或屬性或

839
00:42:46,543 --> 00:42:48,910
local variable that is an object, okay,
局部變量都是一個對象

840
00:42:48,912 --> 00:42:52,980
it's always a pointer to it cuz objects only live in the heap, 'kay?
它總是一個指針，因為對象只在堆中存在著

841
00:42:52,982 --> 00:42:54,648
So you don't need all that extra stars and
所以不需要多餘的 「*」 和 「&」，

842
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:57,184
ampersand, any of that business from other languages, okay?
或者其他語言中類似作用的東西

843
00:42:58,286 --> 00:43:01,587
This exclamation point, by the way, I'm gonna talk about in a few minutes,
順便說一下這個感嘆號，我要談幾分鐘

844
00:43:01,589 --> 00:43:04,023
has nothing to do with this being an object, okay?
這是和對象不相關的

845
00:43:04,025 --> 00:43:05,858
This is, this totally separate thing.
這完全不相干的事情

846
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:07,092
We'll get to it.
我們待會就會理解它

847
00:43:07,094 --> 00:43:08,043
All right.

848
00:43:08,044 --> 00:43:08,993
So let's look at this.
所以讓我們看看這個

849
00:43:08,995 --> 00:43:15,166
This is the syntax for defining a property, 'kay?
這個語法定義了一個屬性，對嗎？

850
00:43:15,168 --> 00:43:16,066
An instance variable.
一個實例變量

851
00:43:16,068 --> 00:43:18,519
And it's very simple.
並且它是如此的簡單

852
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,971
You got var, short for variable cuz that's what this is, a variable.
你看到的這個 var，它是變量（variable）的縮寫

853
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:23,473
The name, this is the name of it, display.
這是變量的名稱：display

854
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:25,475
Okay? That's just the name of this property.
這個屬性的名字就是這個

855
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:26,909
And then :UILabel!
緊接著就是 UILabel

856
00:43:26,911 --> 00:43:28,510
Is the type, 'kay?
這個是它的類型

857
00:43:28,512 --> 00:43:33,815
That's the type of this instance variable.
這個是這個實例變量的類型

858
00:43:33,817 --> 00:43:38,452
So again, I'll talk about the exclamation point later, but
我稍後會講到那個感嘆號

859
00:43:38,454 --> 00:43:42,389
obviously this thing is pointing to this label so that we can talk to it.
但很明顯，我們可以確定這個東西是指向 label 的

860
00:43:42,391 --> 00:43:43,590
And we'll be doing that in a moment.
我們待會就能確定

861
00:43:43,592 --> 00:43:44,424
'Kay?

862
00:43:44,426 --> 00:43:46,325
Questions?
有什麼疑問嗎？

863
00:43:46,327 --> 00:43:49,962
All right, let's talk about another kind of connection we may,
好的，讓我們來談談另一種連接，

864
00:43:49,964 --> 00:43:52,364
we can make, let's start putting some buttons in our calculator.
讓我們開始放一些計算器的按鈕吧

865
00:43:52,366 --> 00:43:55,100
So I'm gonna go back to the Utilities window, 'kay?
我將要回到這個 Utilities 窗口

866
00:43:55,102 --> 00:43:56,734
By pressing this button over here,
按下這個按鈕

867
00:43:56,736 --> 00:44:00,705
go down to the bottom, go to the third tab over here, the object library.
找到下方的第三個選項卡的對象目錄

868
00:44:00,707 --> 00:44:04,775
And instead of a label, this time I'm gonna drag out a button.
這次拖的不是 label，我將要拖出來一個按鈕

869
00:44:04,777 --> 00:44:07,143
Okay? I'm gonna put this button here now.
現在我要把這個按鈕放到這裡

870
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:11,414
Just to be different, I'm not gonna initially line it up with a blue line.
和剛才有點不一樣，沒有初始化藍色的線

871
00:44:11,416 --> 00:44:14,283
I'm just gonna put it kinda in space out here and
我只是想把它放在這個空間中，

872
00:44:14,285 --> 00:44:17,119
I'll line it up with the blue line later, 'kay?
我等下將把它放在藍線的下面

873
00:44:17,121 --> 00:44:19,487
But I don't wanna forget to do that though, I always wanna do that.
希望我待會不會忘記這麼做

874
00:44:19,489 --> 00:44:22,724
What I'm gonna do later is to show you it can be done.
我等下要做的事就是告訴你這是可以做到的

875
00:44:22,726 --> 00:44:26,127
So, this is gonna be, let's say this is gonna be one of our number buttons.
所以，這會是我們其中的一個數字按鈕

876
00:44:26,129 --> 00:44:30,197
Like the upper left corner of our keypad is a 7.
就像鍵盤左上角的數字 7

877
00:44:30,199 --> 00:44:31,598
Okay?

878
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:32,998
Again, I have the same thing over here.
我還需要其他的一些按鈕

879
00:44:33,001 --> 00:44:35,368
Okay? With the attributes inspector I can
通過 attributes inspector ，我能夠

880
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:37,203
change things like the font.
對字體什麼的作出修改

881
00:44:37,205 --> 00:44:40,872
Let's make this be 24 point, let's say.
讓我們試著把字號改成 24

882
00:44:40,874 --> 00:44:42,791
I can resize.
我能這麼調整大小

883
00:44:42,792 --> 00:44:44,709
Notice that when I resize it will actually tell me the size,
注意，當我調整它時候，會實時顯示字號

884
00:44:44,711 --> 00:44:46,978
see it saying there what size it is?
看到這裡顯示的當前的字號

885
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:50,381
I can also set the size maybe with this size inspector right here,
還可以通過在這裡，進行字號的修改

886
00:44:50,383 --> 00:44:51,348
type it in exactly.
輸入精確的字號

887
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:53,517
Maybe 64 by 64, something like that.
先設個 64 x 64

888
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:54,918
We don't usually do that.
我們通常不這樣做

889
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:57,587
We want things to be kinda their natural sizes but
我們希望它能夠是原始的大小

890
00:44:57,589 --> 00:45:01,156
just want to show you that there are other inspectors over here.
但這裡只想向你展示有其他的方法

891
00:45:01,158 --> 00:45:02,491
So we have this 7.
所以我們有這個 7

892
00:45:02,493 --> 00:45:05,460
Now when this 7 is pressed, what do we want to happen?
當 7 被按下的時候，會發生什麼呢？

893
00:45:05,462 --> 00:45:07,963
What we want.
我們想要的是

894
00:45:07,964 --> 00:45:10,465
Numbers just start appearing up here in the display, right?
數字出現在需要展示的地方

895
00:45:10,467 --> 00:45:13,000
So that's something our controller is going to have to do.
這就是我們的控制器必須處理的

896
00:45:13,002 --> 00:45:17,071
So, when we touch this button, we kinda want this button to send a message to
當我們點擊這個按鈕，我們想讓這個按鈕發送信息到

897
00:45:17,073 --> 00:45:21,307
our controller, and we do that the exact same way as we did this one,
我們的控制器，跟之前的方式一樣，

898
00:45:21,309 --> 00:45:25,911
we hold down control, drag into our code.
我們按住 Ctrl，然後點擊拖動它到代碼中

899
00:45:25,913 --> 00:45:29,248
When we let go though, we're not going to an outlet connection this time,
當我們松開時候，這回我們要的不是 outlet 這個連接，

900
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:34,085
because I dont want an instance variable here, what i want is a method, right?
因為我不想要個實例變量，我要的是一個方法對吧？

901
00:45:34,087 --> 00:45:39,790
A function on my class, a method, everyone understand the word method I hope,
我類里的一個函數，方法，我想大家都知道 「方法」 這個詞的含義，

902
00:45:39,792 --> 00:45:44,161
okay, so we want it to send an [INAUDIBLE] message to our control board, so
我們想讓它發送一個消息給控制板

903
00:45:44,163 --> 00:45:48,831
I'm going to pick" action", [COUGH] losing my voice here.
所以我選 "action" ,[咳嗽]，今天有點失聲

904
00:45:48,833 --> 00:45:50,433
Bad time to have a little cold, but.
關鍵時刻有點感冒……不過還好

905
00:45:50,435 --> 00:45:52,968
[SOUND] So I'm doing an action so
所以在這裡我選了 action

906
00:45:52,970 --> 00:45:56,838
an action is a little different than a outlet, okay?
action 跟 outlet 略有不同

907
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,973
An outlet means an instance variable or
outlet 代表一個實例變量

908
00:45:58,975 --> 00:46:01,909
property, action means create a method for me.
或者是一個 property ，action 則是為我創建了一個方法

909
00:46:01,911 --> 00:46:03,944
So again it wants to know the name of the method.
所以緊接著它要我輸入方法的名字

910
00:46:03,946 --> 00:46:05,512
So what does this thing do?
這個方法要做什麼呢？

911
00:46:05,514 --> 00:46:08,815
Well when I press seven, it appends a digit onto the end of
當我按 7 的時候，

912
00:46:08,817 --> 00:46:12,852
whatever's already in the display, so I'm going to call it append,
不管原先顯示著什麼，都在後面加個 7，所以我應該叫它 append...

913
00:46:12,854 --> 00:46:17,390
I could call it append seven, but I'm actually going to call it append digit,
本來應該叫做 append 7，但我還是選擇 appenDigit，

914
00:46:17,392 --> 00:46:20,859
because I want to have one method that all of my buttons use.
因為我想所有的按鈕都使用一個方法

915
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:23,328
All right?
懂了嗎？

916
00:46:23,329 --> 00:46:25,796
I don't want to, copy and pasting a bunch of methods, that would be really bad code.
我不想複製粘貼一堆雷同的方法，那樣只會把代碼變得一團糟

917
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,566
But if I'm gonna have one method,
相反我僅僅使用一個方法，

918
00:46:29,568 --> 00:46:33,437
then I need to know which button is sending me this message, okay?
所以我就需要知道是哪個按鈕發送的這個消息，對吧？

919
00:46:33,439 --> 00:46:37,073
Luckily, when you haven't actioned a message being sent here,
幸運的是，當你從這裡發出消息前

920
00:46:37,075 --> 00:46:40,977
you can specify that it has arguments, you see right here where it says arguments?
你可以規定它有沒有參數，你看這裡它寫著 arguments 了麼？

921
00:46:40,979 --> 00:46:45,414
And it can have no arguments or it can have the sender.
你可以選擇沒有參數，或者是 sender

922
00:46:45,416 --> 00:46:48,483
Which is the button here as the argument.
sender 的意思就是把這個按鈕當作參數

923
00:46:48,485 --> 00:46:52,787
The only tricky thing here is, and I'm not sure why they did this in Xcode.
這裡有點詭異，我不懂 Xcode 為什麼要這樣處理

924
00:46:52,789 --> 00:46:54,455
Hopefully, they'll change it in the future.
希望他們以後能改進下

925
00:46:54,457 --> 00:46:59,092
By default, the type of that argument, which is right here, is anyObject.
就是參數的默認類型是 anyObject

926
00:46:59,094 --> 00:47:01,961
Now, we're gonna talk about anyObject next week.
下周我們會講什麼是 anyObject

927
00:47:01,963 --> 00:47:04,330
But, we don't want anyObject here.
不過在這裡我們肯定不要 anyObject

928
00:47:04,332 --> 00:47:06,599
We know that the sender is a UIButton,
我們知道 sender 其實是 UIButton，

929
00:47:06,601 --> 00:47:09,935
So I picked, click this little blue thing and switch this to UIButton.
所以點這裡選擇 UIButton

930
00:47:09,937 --> 00:47:13,672
When you're doing your homework, if you forget to switch that to UIButton,
如果你做作業的時候，忘了選擇 UIButton，

931
00:47:13,674 --> 00:47:15,907
you'll be sad, okay.
你就悲劇了.

932
00:47:15,909 --> 00:47:17,541
So don't forget.
所以，別忘了哦

933
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:21,978
And obviously the event that the message is gonna be sent on, touch up inside,
然後很明顯，觸發事件應該選為 touch up inside，

934
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:25,448
just means the user touched on this button and the touch went up.
意思是你手指點擊的時候落在按鈕的範圍內

935
00:47:25,450 --> 00:47:27,116
While it was still inside the button.
而手指抬起來時也還在按鈕的範圍內

936
00:47:27,118 --> 00:47:29,952
That's all a touch up inside means there.
這就是 touch up inside 的意思

937
00:47:29,954 --> 00:47:32,021
All right so when I connect this,
當我點了 connect 以後，

938
00:47:32,023 --> 00:47:35,824
I'm gonna get a method with one argument which is a sender which is a UIButton.
我就得到了一個方法，有一個參數，類型是 UIButton

939
00:47:35,826 --> 00:47:38,760
So let's take a look.
讓我們看一下

940
00:47:38,761 --> 00:47:41,695
So here's your first method declaration in SWIFT, okay?
它就是你的第一個 Swift 聲明的方法

941
00:47:41,698 --> 00:47:46,133
Again it's got this little IBAction thing which is kinda like IBOutlet.
同樣這裡有一個叫 IBAction 的東西，跟 IBOutlet 類似

942
00:47:46,135 --> 00:47:47,967
It puts a little dot in the gutter.
左邊有一個小圓點

943
00:47:49,104 --> 00:47:50,436
Okay? So that you can
這樣你就可以看見它連的是哪裡

944
00:47:50,438 --> 00:47:52,938
see what this thing is connected to.
這樣你就可以看見它連的是哪裡

945
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:59,010
So this is the normal, Swift method syntax.
這個就是 Swift 定義方法的標準語法

946
00:47:59,012 --> 00:48:02,213
Starts with func because function,
以 func 開頭，這是 function 的縮寫

947
00:48:02,215 --> 00:48:04,215
basically that method is a function in class.
它就是我們類里的一個方法了

948
00:48:04,217 --> 00:48:06,483
[COUGH] Here's the name.
這是它的名字, AppendDigit

949
00:48:06,485 --> 00:48:07,918
AppendDigit.
這是它的名字，AppendDigit

950
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,987
And then in parentheses, all the arguments separated by commas.
在括號里，所有參數都用逗號分隔

951
00:48:10,989 --> 00:48:12,989
We only have one argument, though.
我們這只有一個參數

952
00:48:12,991 --> 00:48:15,057
Here's the name of the first argument.
這個是第一個參數的名字

953
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:18,860
That's the name we're going to use to access it inside of our method, and
我們在方法里就要用到這個名字，

954
00:48:18,862 --> 00:48:20,295
here is the type.
這是它的類型

955
00:48:21,264 --> 00:48:22,496
Okay? It's a UIButton.
懂了麼？類型是 UIButton

956
00:48:22,498 --> 00:48:24,598
I, notice no exclamation point there, by the way.
順便提下，要注意到這裡是沒有嘆號的

957
00:48:26,535 --> 00:48:31,237
Okay if this had a return value, if this method returned something this one doesn't
雖然這個方法沒有返回值，但如果

958
00:48:31,239 --> 00:48:36,208
[COUGH] but if it returned something, it would look like this arrow the return type
如果它有的話，這裡就寫這樣的箭頭

959
00:48:37,745 --> 00:48:40,311
okay so that's how you specify a return type.
這樣就定義了它的返回類型

960
00:48:42,215 --> 00:48:48,185
Okay, pretty simple the syntax and then inside here we just type,
看見了麼？非常簡單的語法

961
00:48:48,187 --> 00:48:51,822
well whatever we want this thing to do when one of these buttons is touched.
繼續看我們的函數，當點擊了其中一個按鈕，

962
00:48:51,824 --> 00:48:53,774
So what do we want it to do?
我們要讓它幹甚麼

963
00:48:53,775 --> 00:48:55,725
Well, okay, first of all before we do that, let's go ahead and make more of
在此之前，我們先多弄幾個按鈕

964
00:48:55,727 --> 00:48:58,928
these buttons because I need seven, eight, nine, four, five, six, all this.
我們還需要其他的按鈕，4，5，6 等等等等

965
00:48:58,930 --> 00:49:01,664
So let's copy and paste the button.
我們可以複製粘貼這些按鈕

966
00:49:01,666 --> 00:49:04,400
When I copy and
當我複製粘貼這些按鈕

967
00:49:04,401 --> 00:49:07,135
paste the button, notice I'm using the blue lines to put it perfectly lined up.
注意我用這些藍線來對齊

968
00:49:07,138 --> 00:49:11,373
Okay, also notice that it there also sending this message.
而且它們都同樣發送這個消息

969
00:49:11,375 --> 00:49:14,776
All right, see how their both sending the message, because when I copy and
它們發送同樣這個消息是為什麼呢

970
00:49:14,778 --> 00:49:18,012
paste, it copied that aspect of it as well.
因為拷貝按鈕的時候連同這些信息也一起拷貝了

971
00:49:18,014 --> 00:49:21,182
So there's another one, I could select all three of these and
可以一次選三個，一起拷貝

972
00:49:21,184 --> 00:49:27,154
copy and paste, okay, I could select all six of these and copy and paste.
6 個一起選

973
00:49:27,156 --> 00:49:30,990
So I can quickly make, my entire keypad.
這樣快速得把鍵盤造出來了

974
00:49:30,992 --> 00:49:33,343
Just need to edit the title.
只需要改改 title

975
00:49:33,344 --> 00:49:35,695
Now, if while I'm editing these titles, sometimes you're clicking around in
如果你像現在這樣，做些改動，點來點去

976
00:49:35,697 --> 00:49:39,431
here and, you know, you're not a very accurate clicker.
不小心沒點准

977
00:49:39,433 --> 00:49:43,368
[LAUGH] Or, you know, you just get out, out of control clicking here, and oh,
手一滑把控件拖飛了

978
00:49:43,370 --> 00:49:45,236
you moved it out of the way.
手一滑把控件拖飛了

979
00:49:45,238 --> 00:49:46,821
Okay?
怎麼辦？

980
00:49:46,822 --> 00:49:48,405
No problem, you can just put it right back in.
沒關係，只要把它再拖回原地

981
00:49:48,408 --> 00:49:51,675
Okay, use the blue lines to your advantage.
那些藍色的輔助線會幫你個大忙

982
00:49:52,844 --> 00:49:55,278
And we'll put our zero down here.
把 0 放在這

983
00:49:55,279 --> 00:49:57,713
And I don't need these buttons so I'm just hit, selecting it, hitting delete.
選中這些，按下 Delete，我們就可以把不需要的按鈕刪除

984
00:49:57,716 --> 00:49:59,715
That's how you can get rid of something.
就這麼刪東西

985
00:49:59,717 --> 00:50:02,985
And I promised I was gonna put these all on blue lines, so I'm gonna do that.
我剛才說過要把它們對齊藍線

986
00:50:02,987 --> 00:50:05,921
I'm gonna put it right underneath the zero.
把它們放在 0 標籤控件的底下

987
00:50:05,923 --> 00:50:08,890
So here's a blue line that means underneath the zero, and
這條藍線就表明我可以放在標籤底下

988
00:50:08,892 --> 00:50:10,692
then I'm going to put at this edge.
讓它對起左邊這條藍線

989
00:50:10,694 --> 00:50:14,962
So now you can see that the blue lines are not just the edges, but
你可以發現，這些藍線不僅在調整邊緣的時候出現

990
00:50:14,964 --> 00:50:17,965
they are other objects, like the other objects in the keypad and
在調整其他對象，比如這些按鈕的時候，它們也會出現

991
00:50:17,967 --> 00:50:20,667
also now the title, the display rather at the top.
同樣，標題，標籤這些也同樣受用

992
00:50:21,870 --> 00:50:26,205
So I've got all these buttons, they're all sending this message append digit.
現在按鈕齊了，它們都發送 appendDigit 這個消息

993
00:50:26,207 --> 00:50:28,874
So I need to figure out which one is sending it,
所以我就需要分辨出是哪個按鈕發送的消息

994
00:50:28,876 --> 00:50:30,942
so that I can do the right thing.
然後針對性的做相應的功能

995
00:50:30,944 --> 00:50:33,611
So let's start writing some code inside the method.
現在讓我們來往這個方法里添加代碼

996
00:50:33,613 --> 00:50:37,281
So the first thing I'm going to do is declare a local variable,
首先，我要聲明一個局部變量

997
00:50:37,283 --> 00:50:39,917
it's just a local variable inside this method.
就是方法內部的局部變量

998
00:50:39,919 --> 00:50:43,520
I'm going to do that by saying let digit equal.
輸入 let digit =

999
00:50:43,522 --> 00:50:47,824
So I want this local variable to be the digit that was pressed.
我想讓這個局部變量表示我們輸入的數字

1000
00:50:47,826 --> 00:50:50,743
Okay.
我想讓這個變量表示我們輸入的數字

1001
00:50:50,744 --> 00:50:53,661
So, first thing that's quite different here is, what's let?
這裡值得注意的是，這個 let 是什麼？

1002
00:50:53,664 --> 00:50:54,363
Okay?

1003
00:50:54,365 --> 00:50:56,999
Why isn't this var, right?
為什麼不是跟上面那個一樣的 var ？

1004
00:50:57,001 --> 00:51:00,735
Cuz var means variable, what the heck does let mean?
因為 var 是變量的意思，那 let 是什麼鬼？

1005
00:51:00,737 --> 00:51:05,973
Well let is exactly the same as var except it's a constant.
其實 let 跟 var 差不多，只不過 let 代表常量

1006
00:51:07,143 --> 00:51:10,744
Which means you're going to sign this right off the bat, and
意味著一旦你為它設置了初值

1007
00:51:10,746 --> 00:51:13,046
it's never going to change in this method.
它在這個方法內就再也不能被改變了

1008
00:51:13,048 --> 00:51:15,415
Now Swift makes a big deal about this, and
這在 Swift 里很重要

1009
00:51:15,417 --> 00:51:19,552
I love this feature, because if I'm reading this code,
我大愛這個特性，因為當我讀代碼的時候，

1010
00:51:19,554 --> 00:51:23,355
I know the digit is never going to change all, this might be, you know.
我知道它不會變，而上面那個（var）會變

1011
00:51:23,357 --> 00:51:24,856
It might have a dozen lines of code.
假設你的方法里有幾十行代碼，

1012
00:51:24,858 --> 00:51:26,792
Which by the way,
順便提一下，

1013
00:51:26,793 --> 00:51:28,727
you shouldn't have very many methods, with many more lines of code then that.
你最好別在一個方法裡面塞太多的代碼，

1014
00:51:28,729 --> 00:51:30,294
Okay? You want people to be able to
你應該讓人清楚明瞭的知道你這個方法要做的是什麼事情

1015
00:51:30,296 --> 00:51:31,796
kind of see what a method's doing.
你應該讓人清楚明瞭的知道你這個方法要做的是什麼事情

1016
00:51:33,232 --> 00:51:34,765
You can use other methods,
你可以添加其他的方法，

1017
00:51:34,767 --> 00:51:37,801
call other methods if you need to get more code in there.
然後通過調用那些方法來實現更多的邏輯

1018
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:38,935
so.
回過頭來

1019
00:51:38,937 --> 00:51:39,835
Here I can de-,
回過頭來

1020
00:51:39,837 --> 00:51:41,270
rely on that not changing.
因為有了這個 「不變」 的性質，

1021
00:51:41,272 --> 00:51:44,406
That's big for readability.
代碼的可讀性得到了很大的提升

1022
00:51:44,407 --> 00:51:47,541
You'll be surprised how much more readable it makes the code, to know that this is a,
你會驚嘆僅僅知道哪些是變量，哪些是常量，就會對代碼的可閱讀性帶來這麼大的提升

1023
00:51:47,544 --> 00:51:49,177
local variable, but it's constant.
你會驚嘆僅僅知道哪些是變量，哪些是常量，就會對代碼的可閱讀性帶來這麼大的提升

1024
00:51:49,179 --> 00:51:50,111
Only set at the beginning.
只需要聲明的時候加個關鍵字就行

1025
00:51:50,113 --> 00:51:52,913
Yeah. Is there a reason, constants and
[學生提問] 對於像變量、常量這些東西，這裡為什麼都用相同的命名規範？

1026
00:51:52,915 --> 00:51:54,715
like, variables have the same naming convention.
[學生提問] 對於像變量、常量這些東西，這裡為什麼都使用相同的命名規範？

1027
00:51:54,717 --> 00:51:56,450
Since [UNKNOWN] like Java there.
因為比如說 Java 會用 「全部大寫」 或者 「全部小寫」 來區別這些概念

1028
00:51:56,451 --> 00:51:58,184
Like the naming conventions like all caps or lowercase.
因為比如說 Java 會用 「全部大寫」 或者 「全部小寫」 來區別這些概念

1029
00:51:58,186 --> 00:52:00,770
Yeah. So, yeah.
[提問完畢]

1030
00:52:00,771 --> 00:52:03,355
The question is, why don't I call digit like all caps digit, or
這位同學的問題是，為什麼不把 digit 寫成 DIGIT，

1031
00:52:03,358 --> 00:52:05,424
something like that, so I know it's a constant.
以此來區分它是不是常量

1032
00:52:05,426 --> 00:52:07,626
That would be a programming style thing.
這算是編程風格的問題，

1033
00:52:07,628 --> 00:52:10,929
Generally in Swift they don't do that.
但在 Swift 里，我們通常不這樣做

1034
00:52:10,931 --> 00:52:13,765
And, I'll show you why that is in a moment.
我之後會給你們演示，

1035
00:52:13,767 --> 00:52:15,233
Why you don't really need to do that.
為什麼我們不需要通過玩弄命名規範來區別這些概念，

1036
00:52:15,235 --> 00:52:18,069
Because you can very quickly find out the declaration of
因為你可以非常快速的找到每個變量的定義，

1037
00:52:18,071 --> 00:52:22,406
any symbol anywhere with one click, and you'll see that.
只需要點一下鼠標就一目瞭然

1038
00:52:22,408 --> 00:52:25,209
Good question though.
是個好問題

1039
00:52:25,210 --> 00:52:28,011
All right, so I wanna let the digit, equal the number that's on the,
所以，接下來我要 let digit = 被觸發的按鈕上的那個數字

1040
00:52:28,013 --> 00:52:30,196
the sending button.
所以，接下來我要 let digit = 被觸發的按鈕上的那個數字

1041
00:52:30,197 --> 00:52:32,380
So I'm gonna have to send a message to this button.
所以我要向那個按鈕發送一個消息

1042
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:34,316
Okay? Gonna have to somehow access this button.
對吧？我們得訪問這個按鈕對象

1043
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:37,886
So I'm gonna have to do sender, something.
我就打 sender 然後..

1044
00:52:37,888 --> 00:52:40,655
Give me what your title is, okay?
拿到它的 title 對吧？

1045
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:44,091
So this is a good time to talk about the documentation.
現在就是講講文檔的好時機了

1046
00:52:44,093 --> 00:52:45,543
[COUGH].
[咳嗽]

1047
00:52:45,544 --> 00:52:46,994
Because being a good iOS developer,
想要成為一名好的 iOS 開發者，

1048
00:52:46,996 --> 00:52:50,397
really demands that you are good at navigating the documentation.
熟練地使用文檔是必須的

1049
00:52:50,399 --> 00:52:54,334
Luckily, the documentation is really well plugged in to Xcode.
幸運的是，Xcode 已經完美地嵌入了文檔支持

1050
00:52:54,336 --> 00:52:57,036
For example, if I wanna find out about button,
比如，我想看看按鈕的文檔

1051
00:52:57,038 --> 00:53:00,339
all I need to do is hold down the option key.
我只要按住 option 鍵

1052
00:53:00,341 --> 00:53:01,373
Okay?
我只要按住 option 鍵

1053
00:53:01,375 --> 00:53:02,974
And watch what happens now.
看見有什麼變化麼？

1054
00:53:02,976 --> 00:53:04,542
As I mouse over things,
當我的鼠標移動到文本上方時，它們底下就會出現一條藍色的虛線

1055
00:53:04,544 --> 00:53:09,680
everything, it turns blue with a dashed blue line under it, okay?
當我的鼠標移動到文本上方時，它們底下就會出現一條藍色的虛線

1056
00:53:09,682 --> 00:53:10,748
If I click on it,
如果我點擊

1057
00:53:12,117 --> 00:53:14,884
it gives me a little blurb from the documentation about this thing.
它就彈出一個文檔的摘要

1058
00:53:14,886 --> 00:53:17,954
So it's saying, you know, here's, button is a class.
它說這是 button， 這是一個類，

1059
00:53:17,956 --> 00:53:19,288
Here's its inheritance.
這裡有它的繼承關係

1060
00:53:19,290 --> 00:53:20,689
Here's a little bit of what it does.
這裡是關於它的功能

1061
00:53:20,691 --> 00:53:22,691
And really awesome at the bottom here,
最棒的是在最後這裡，

1062
00:53:22,693 --> 00:53:25,427
here's a link that takes you to the detailed documentation.
這是一個指向詳細文檔的鏈接

1063
00:53:25,429 --> 00:53:27,962
So I'm gonna click this little link right here.
我點擊這個鏈接

1064
00:53:27,964 --> 00:53:34,501
It's going to be up a documentation window, with UIButton in it, hello?
它就打開了 UIButton 的文檔窗口……咦？

1065
00:53:34,503 --> 00:53:38,038
Did I not click that right thing here,
我沒點錯吧？

1066
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:43,076
oh I hope I don't have a network issue here.
不會是網絡出問題了吧..

1067
00:53:43,078 --> 00:53:47,046
hm, okay well, I guess I'm not connected to the network,
好吧，我猜我的網絡出問題了

1068
00:53:47,048 --> 00:53:50,149
that's the problem, so it's getting this off the network.
果然，沒有聯上網。

1069
00:53:50,151 --> 00:53:53,819
Okay so.
好吧

1070
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:57,488
Imagine that there were documentation here and, it would have along this side here
那就想象一下，文檔出現在了這裡

1071
00:53:57,491 --> 00:54:03,294
on the left all the instance variables or properties and methods of u i button.
在窗口的左邊，就會出現很長的一列關於 UIButton 的屬性，變量，方法什麼的

1072
00:54:03,296 --> 00:54:05,929
And you could click on any one, and
你可以點擊它們

1073
00:54:05,931 --> 00:54:08,165
in there we'd have a full description of it here.
然後就可以在這裡看見完整的描述

1074
00:54:08,167 --> 00:54:11,735
And all the types that it referenced you could click on it here, and
所有文檔間的引用你都可以點擊，

1075
00:54:11,737 --> 00:54:14,504
basically it's a hyper linked documentation [UNKNOWN].
它本質上就是一些文檔間的超鏈接，

1076
00:54:14,506 --> 00:54:16,773
As you can imagine.
你可以想象得到的

1077
00:54:16,774 --> 00:54:19,041
I'll try to get the networking working on Wednesday and we'll take a look at this.
我爭取在下週三把網絡問題搞定，到時候我們就能一睹芳容了

1078
00:54:19,043 --> 00:54:21,494
But if I was looking in here,
假設我能看到文檔的話，

1079
00:54:21,495 --> 00:54:23,946
I'd look down in the section that says getting the button's current state, and
我會在這裡找到一些如何獲取 UIButton 狀態的信息

1080
00:54:23,948 --> 00:54:30,185
I'd find that there is an instance property there called current title.
我會找到一個叫做 currentTitle 的屬性

1081
00:54:30,187 --> 00:54:31,552
Okay? It's unfortunate I'm not going to
很遺憾沒能演示這個流程

1082
00:54:31,554 --> 00:54:32,186
link these things.
很遺憾沒能演示這個流程

1083
00:54:32,188 --> 00:54:33,687
But.
不過問題不大

1084
00:54:33,689 --> 00:54:39,993
So how do we access, property or call a method in another object,
那麼怎麼訪問到一個對象的屬性、方法呢？

1085
00:54:39,995 --> 00:54:43,429
will look exactly the same whether you call it a method or
答案是，訪問屬性和調用方法的方式是一模一樣的

1086
00:54:43,431 --> 00:54:46,332
accessing a property, which is you use dot.
訪問屬性，你用點(.)

1087
00:54:46,334 --> 00:54:49,435
Okay. It's the same syntax that's used in
這跟大多數語言是一樣的，都用點號來訪問成員

1088
00:54:49,437 --> 00:54:52,771
a lot of languages is to, to do dot.
這跟大多數語言是一樣的，都用點號來訪問成員

1089
00:54:52,773 --> 00:54:55,173
And so when you do that, Xcode is going to say, oh,
當你在 Xcode 里打一個點的時候，它就說，吶，

1090
00:54:55,175 --> 00:54:58,209
well, here's all the things button knows how to do.
這裡是所有 UIButton 可訪問的成員

1091
00:54:58,211 --> 00:54:59,894
Okay?
看見了麼？

1092
00:54:59,895 --> 00:55:01,578
And as you can see, button knows how to do a lot of things.
你可以發現，UIButton 能做很多事情，

1093
00:55:01,581 --> 00:55:03,747
Because it inherits from a class, it inherits from a class,
這是因為它繼承於一個類，它的父類又繼承於另一個類，不停繼承

1094
00:55:03,749 --> 00:55:07,451
it inherits from a class, that all have lots of methods in them.
所以累積起來就有很多方法可供調用

1095
00:55:07,453 --> 00:55:10,320
So when I looked at that documentation.
所以當我查看了文檔以後，

1096
00:55:10,322 --> 00:55:13,823
I've found that current title was the thing I wanted.
我知道 currentTitle 這個屬性正是我想要的

1097
00:55:13,825 --> 00:55:18,194
Now notice as I start to type a c, it's already cutting down
注意這裡我打個字母 c，它會幫我過濾出那些開頭是 c 的選擇

1098
00:55:18,196 --> 00:55:23,331
the things that could be starting with a c, and then c u, they cut down even more.
然後接著打 cu，它有棒我過濾掉了一些

1099
00:55:23,333 --> 00:55:28,770
I can type tab, to get to the first ambiguity point, then I can type t.
我可以按 Tab 鍵，前進到第一個歧義點，然後接著打 t

1100
00:55:29,739 --> 00:55:31,889
Okay?
我可以按 Tab 鍵，前進到第一個歧義點，然後接著打 t

1101
00:55:31,890 --> 00:55:35,875
And then tab again, and I'm here at currentTitle and then I can press return. Okay?
然後再敲 Tab 鍵，得到 currentTitle，然後按 Enter 鍵

1103
00:55:35,877 --> 00:55:37,327
So there it is.
好了

1104
00:55:37,328 --> 00:55:38,778
digit = sender.currentTitle

1105
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:45,484
so, what's going on here in terms of the sender title.
我們現在拿到了 sender 的 currentTitle 了，然後呢？

1106
00:55:45,486 --> 00:55:49,520
Let's go ahead and print this out to the console just to see what's going on.
我們把它在 console（控制台）中打印出來，看看它裡面是什麼東西

1107
00:55:49,522 --> 00:55:50,688
So I'm gonna println.
這裡使用 println 函數

1108
00:55:50,690 --> 00:55:55,992
At which is a function, a global function that takes a String.
它是一個全局函數，以一個 String 為參數

1109
00:55:55,994 --> 00:55:57,694
So I give it a String.
所以我就給它一個 String

1110
00:55:57,696 --> 00:55:59,762
And inside that String, I'll type mm,
在 String 里，我打

1111
00:55:59,764 --> 00:56:05,000
digit equals and now I wanna embed the value of digit in this String.
"digit = "，我想把 digit 的值嵌入到這個 string 裡面

1112
00:56:05,002 --> 00:56:08,337
And Swift has a really cool feature which is backslash open parentheses
這裡介紹一個 Swift 很酷的特性，就是，

1113
00:56:08,339 --> 00:56:11,924
close parentheses.
如果你在字符串里里放進這個 "\()"，然後你就可以在括號裡面放入一個表達式

1114
00:56:11,925 --> 00:56:15,510
If you put that in a String, and then inside there you put some expression, then
如果你在字符串里里放進這個 "\()"，然後你就可以在括號裡面放入一個表達式

1115
00:56:15,512 --> 00:56:21,048
it will evaluate that expression turn it into a String, and embed it in the String.
Swift 就會對這個表達式求值，然後把值轉換成 String，最後嵌入到那個字符串里

1116
00:56:21,050 --> 00:56:24,718
Okay, so its really easy to println values by
所以用這個 "\()" 語法可以很方便的 println 一個對象的值

1117
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:28,254
using this backslash parenthesis. Okay?
所以用這個 "\()" 語法可以很方便的 println 一個對象的值

1119
00:56:28,256 --> 00:56:30,189
So let's go ahead and run and
現在讓我們編譯運行然後

1120
00:56:30,190 --> 00:56:32,123
see what happens when we press these buttons to see what kind of result we get.
看看我們按這些按鈕的時候會打印出什麼結果

1121
00:56:32,126 --> 00:56:35,027
It's not going to be quite what we expect, but let's see.
結果可能會跟預期的有所不同，

1122
00:56:37,864 --> 00:56:42,066
Alright so, here's our UI we got our buttons that's a good start.
好咧，這裡是我們的 UI，有了一些按鈕，看起來不錯

1123
00:56:42,068 --> 00:56:44,435
And now, and console, where's the console?
但是控制台呢？輸出結果的控制台去哪了？

1124
00:56:44,437 --> 00:56:46,269
Watch this. I'm going to press a button five.
看好了，當我點擊 5 按鈕的時候

1125
00:56:47,372 --> 00:56:49,238
The console appears at the bottom here.
控制台就在下面出現了

1126
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:50,172
See this down here.
看見了嗎？在底欄這裡

1127
00:56:50,174 --> 00:56:51,874
This is the console.
這就是控制台

1128
00:56:51,876 --> 00:56:56,277
And it's saying digit equals, hm, optional five.
這裡顯示了， digit 等於……呃……Optional("5")

1129
00:56:56,279 --> 00:56:57,211
Okay.
好吧

1130
00:56:57,213 --> 00:56:58,746
How about a nine?
那 9 呢？

1131
00:56:58,748 --> 00:56:59,713
They're all optional.
也是 Optional 的

1132
00:56:59,715 --> 00:57:03,250
What the heck is going on here? Okay.
這是什麼鬼?

1134
00:57:03,251 --> 00:57:05,418
This is crucial to understanding Swift.
接下來我們將要理解一個 Swift 里的重要概念

1135
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:08,421
This is probably the most important thing to understand that
這個概念初學者常常會搞錯，但在 Swift 里它非常特別十分重要

1136
00:57:08,423 --> 00:57:11,424
people don't quite get right from the start.
這個概念初學者常常會搞錯，但在 Swift 里它非常特別十分重要的

1137
00:57:11,426 --> 00:57:15,827
So we're really going to focus here on understanding what
所以接下來我們集中精力，好好的理解這個 Optional 到底是什麼意思

1138
00:57:15,829 --> 00:57:17,862
optional means right there.
所以接下來我們集中精力，好好的理解這個 Optional 到底是什麼意思

1139
00:57:17,864 --> 00:57:18,730
Okay?
注意聽咯

1140
00:57:18,731 --> 00:57:19,597
So let's go back to our code.
先回到代碼

1141
00:57:22,168 --> 00:57:25,969
And look at this, oh and by the way it, when the console appears down here,
看這個，對了，順便提一下，當控制台出現了以後，

1142
00:57:25,971 --> 00:57:28,538
you can make it go away with this little button, or
你可以用這個按鈕把它隱藏掉，或者

1143
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:31,274
you can just drag it out of the way okay?
也可以用鼠標把它拖走

1144
00:57:31,276 --> 00:57:34,711
But sometimes it's nice to have that console still there, so
不過讓它一直顯示在那裡也挺好的，

1145
00:57:34,713 --> 00:57:39,548
you can look at your output while you're you know reacting to whatever you found,
你可以隨時看見你的輸出，及時察覺問題

1146
00:57:39,550 --> 00:57:41,750
in fact we will leave that up there, so you can see the optionals.
我就不隱藏它了，讓你可以看見我們現在要講的 Optional

1147
00:57:42,753 --> 00:57:45,186
Alright, so, what's going on here?
言歸正傳

1148
00:57:45,188 --> 00:57:48,956
Well, what's happening here is, well, first of all,
首先，

1149
00:57:48,958 --> 00:57:52,759
don't you find this a little bit odd, let digit, I didn't put a type.
你有沒有發現一個奇怪的地方？ 這裡 let digit = …… 我並沒有給 digit 一個類型

1150
00:57:52,761 --> 00:57:55,595
You see that?
看到麼？

1151
00:57:55,597 --> 00:57:57,663
How, what type is digit?
那這個 digit 到底是什麼類型呢？

1152
00:57:57,665 --> 00:58:02,334
Okay, well there's no type in there, no type information whatsoever, so.
你可能會想，這裡沒有指定任何類型，難道 Swift 支持無類型變量？

1153
00:58:02,336 --> 00:58:04,636
Does Swift have untyped variables?
你可能會想，這裡沒有指定任何類型，難道 Swift 支持無類型變量？

1154
00:58:04,638 --> 00:58:06,171
No, it's exact opposite.
錯！恰恰相反

1155
00:58:06,173 --> 00:58:10,141
Swift is very strongly typed. Okay.
Swift 是非常非常強類型的語言

1157
00:58:10,142 --> 00:58:11,341
All variables have a type.
所有變量都有它的類型

1158
00:58:11,344 --> 00:58:12,943
You have to specify type.
你必須規定一個類型

1159
00:58:12,945 --> 00:58:17,847
But, Swift is also incredibly good at what's called type inference.
然後，Swift 有一個非常強大的特性，叫做類型推導

1160
00:58:17,849 --> 00:58:20,817
So it can infer the type from the context.
這樣它就能通過當前上下文來推斷出變量的類型

1161
00:58:20,819 --> 00:58:25,554
So here I let digit equalwhatever this is, this currentTitle, and
所以，當我寫 digit = ... 無論我等號後面寫什麼，這個 currentTitle，

1162
00:58:25,556 --> 00:58:29,391
so it just made digit be the same type as this.
它都能將 digit 設置成等號後面那個東西的類型

1163
00:58:29,393 --> 00:58:31,543
Okay.
懂了麼？

1164
00:58:31,544 --> 00:58:33,694
Now back to the question earlier, so what type is that?
回到之前的問題，那麼這個到底是什麼類型？

1165
00:58:33,697 --> 00:58:37,365
Well, if I hold down option, okay, just like we used option to
我可以按住 Option 鍵，就像查看文檔那樣，

1166
00:58:37,367 --> 00:58:42,636
go look into the documentation, we can also option click on our own variables.
我們也可以按住 Option 來點擊我們的變量，

1167
00:58:42,638 --> 00:58:44,337
To see are they constant?
看看它是常量還是變量

1168
00:58:44,339 --> 00:58:45,204
Are they variables?
它們是變量麼？

1169
00:58:45,206 --> 00:58:46,138
And what type are they?
還可以看看它們是什麼類型?

1170
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:47,306
So watch this.
看這個

1171
00:58:47,308 --> 00:58:50,225
Option click.
按住 Option 然後點擊

1172
00:58:50,226 --> 00:58:53,143
It says digit is of type String question mark.
它說，digit 是 「String?」 類型的

1173
00:58:53,146 --> 00:58:54,579
Okay? String question mark.
嗯，String 後面有個問號

1174
00:58:55,515 --> 00:58:58,248
That question mark means optional.
這個問號的意思是 —— 「Optional（可選）」

1175
00:58:58,250 --> 00:59:02,585
So there is a type in Swift, it's a type, called optional.
在 Swift 裡面，有一種類型，叫做 optional

1177
00:59:02,587 --> 00:59:08,257
Okay. Optional, that type can have only two values.
Optional 這種類型，只有兩個值

1178
00:59:08,259 --> 00:59:10,592
One value is not set.
一個值叫：未設

1179
00:59:12,095 --> 00:59:16,997
Okay, this optional is not set, there has never been set or someone has
代表著這個值還沒有被任何人設置過，或者，有人故意把它設置成了 「未設」 狀態

1180
00:59:16,999 --> 00:59:20,934
set it to the not set state, they unset it if you want to think about it that way.
代表著這個值還沒有被任何人設置過，或者，有人故意把它設置成了 「未設」 狀態

1181
00:59:20,936 --> 00:59:25,405
So optional one value is not set, we call that there's a, symbol for
當一個 Optional 的變量是 「未設」 狀態時，

1182
00:59:25,407 --> 00:59:28,241
it in here called nil, N, I, L, okay?
有一個符號用來表示這個狀態，這個符號叫做 nil, N, I, L.

1183
00:59:28,243 --> 00:59:31,210
That means not set, that's the value of an optional not set.
nil 就是 「未設」 的意思，就是 optional 變量在 「未設」 狀態下的值

1184
00:59:31,212 --> 00:59:34,747
That's the only thing nil means in Swift is option this is an optional,
在 Swift 里，nil 只有這一個意義，就是說這個變量是 Optional 的，

1185
00:59:34,749 --> 00:59:36,948
the value of an optional that is not set.
而且它的值是 「未設」

1186
00:59:36,950 --> 00:59:41,586
What's the other value that an optional could have well the other value is.
那 Optional 的另一種值是是什麼呢？

1187
00:59:41,588 --> 00:59:44,655
Something, it's set to something, okay.
「有值」，就是說它被設置賦了一個值

1188
00:59:44,657 --> 00:59:47,624
And the type of that something is what,
那 「有值」 的這個值，是什麼類型呢？

1189
00:59:47,626 --> 00:59:51,261
is specified next to the question mark String.
就是 「?」 前面那個東西代表的類型

1190
00:59:51,263 --> 00:59:55,932
So really you can almost think of the question mark there, that's the type
所以，你可以這樣想：

1191
00:59:55,934 --> 01:00:00,769
optional, and that String to the left is just saying if this optional is set,
問號左邊的那個 String，就表示，如果這個 Optional 變量被賦了值的話，那麼它的類型就是 String

1192
01:00:00,771 --> 01:00:04,139
what type of thing is it set to, in this case a String.
問號左邊的那個 String，就表示，如果這個 Optional 變量被賦了值的話，那麼它的類型就是 String

1193
01:00:04,141 --> 01:00:06,941
So we would call this an optional String.
所以，我們可以稱其為 「Optional String」

1194
01:00:06,943 --> 01:00:11,846
But it's really an optional, it's not a String that can be nil,
但是它實際上確確實實是 Optional 類型的，它不是一個可以為 nil 的 String

1195
01:00:11,848 --> 01:00:14,815
it's an optional that can be a String.
它是 Optional 類型，只不過可以被賦值為 Stirng

1196
01:00:14,817 --> 01:00:16,516
Everybody cool with that sentence?
好好理解這句話

1197
01:00:16,518 --> 01:00:19,019
That's an important sentence to understand, okay.
理解這個句子和含義非常非常關鍵

1198
01:00:20,055 --> 01:00:23,956
So, this got to be an optional because this currentTitle method right here,
所以在這裡，currentTitle 返回的值肯定是 Optional 類型的

1199
01:00:23,958 --> 01:00:26,525
returns an optional String, let's look at that.
我們來看看

1200
01:00:26,527 --> 01:00:29,094
So I'm going to press Option down here, click.
按住 Option 點 currentTitle

1201
01:00:29,096 --> 01:00:31,529
Look at this, this is the documentation for it.
看，這是它的文檔

1201
01:00:31,531 --> 01:00:36,334
It's an instance variable a, a, property on UIButton.
這是一個實例變量，UIButton 的屬性

1202
01:00:36,336 --> 01:00:37,267
Name is currentTitle.
名字是 currentTitle

1203
01:00:37,269 --> 01:00:39,302
The type is String, question mark.
類型是 「String?」

1204
01:00:39,304 --> 01:00:41,271
And this little get means it's read-only.
而這裡的 「get」 表示這個是只讀的

1205
01:00:41,273 --> 01:00:42,672
I can only get the currentTitle.
我只能 get（讀取值） currentTitle

1206
01:00:42,674 --> 01:00:44,807
I can't set it, there are other ways to set a button's title.
但是我不能 set （寫入值），有其他方式 set 這個按鈕的 title

1207
01:00:44,809 --> 01:00:47,810
You can't set it with this method or this property.
你不能通過這個方法或者屬性 set 這個 title

1208
01:00:47,812 --> 01:00:51,480
So it's an optional, so that's why this ended up being an optional all right.
所以這是一個 optional，這就是為什麼它最後也是 optional

1209
01:00:51,482 --> 01:00:53,081
Well, that's all wonderful.
嗯，這非常不錯

1210
01:00:53,083 --> 01:00:54,549
How do I get the String?
那我該如何獲取這個 String 呢？

1211
01:00:54,551 --> 01:00:57,318
I don't want it optional, I want that button's String.
我不希望它是 optional 的，我要的是這個按鈕的 String

1212
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:02,923
And the way you do that is you unwrap the optional, meaning you look in there and
方法就是解包這個 optional，意思是你打開這個它找到裡面的東西，

1213
01:01:02,925 --> 01:01:08,061
get the val, the associated value, with exclamation point, okay.
用 「!」 就可以獲取到它的值

1214
01:01:08,063 --> 01:01:11,330
What happens if I put that exclamation point there?
如果我把感嘆號放在這裡會怎麼樣？

1215
01:01:11,332 --> 01:01:13,732
Well first of all, let me show you that when I put that exclamation point,
首先我先會展示給你們看，當我把感嘆號放在這裡

1216
01:01:13,734 --> 01:01:17,002
look what happened to digit, I'm Option-clicking on digit.
看看會有什麼變化，我現在點擊數字 我按 Option 然後點擊這個 digit

1217
01:01:17,004 --> 01:01:19,270
It's not an optional anymore.
它不再是 optional 類型了

1218
01:01:19,272 --> 01:01:22,507
Digit turned to a String because I unwrapped the optional that
digit 變成了 String，因為我把 optional 解包了，

1219
01:01:22,509 --> 01:01:25,576
came back from currentTitle, got the String out of there.
從 currentTitle 里得到了 String

1220
01:01:25,578 --> 01:01:28,612
But what happens if this is nil?
但是如果這是個 nil 值會怎麼樣？

1221
01:01:28,614 --> 01:01:30,180
What happened if this optional is nil?
如果 optional 是 nil 會怎樣呢？

1222
01:01:30,182 --> 01:01:34,718
In other words the button optional has never been set, crash, 'kay,
換句話說，就是這些 optional 類型的按鈕沒有 set 值會怎樣？對的，程序會崩潰

1223
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:39,855
crashes your program, so if you use exclamation point to unwrap an optional,
所以如果你使用 "!" 號來解包一個 optional 的時候

1224
01:01:39,857 --> 01:01:45,660
and that optional's current value is not set, nil, then it will crash your program.
並且這個 optional 的 currentTitle 沒有設值，為 nil 的時候，你的程序會崩潰

1225
01:01:46,930 --> 01:01:50,498
Now a lot of you might be like whoa, I'm, my products are gonna be crashing all over
現在你們中的不少人肯定在想，我的程序將會整天 crash 掉，

1226
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:55,903
the place and, because there's a lot of optionals in iOS, I mean a lot, okay?
因為 iOS 有著非常多的 optional，非，常，多

1227
01:01:55,905 --> 01:01:58,939
Most things are probably optionals, because most things, it make sense,
大部分東西都是 optional 的，因為大部分東西都是有意義的

1228
01:01:58,941 --> 01:02:00,840
they can be in an not set state at some point.
某些時候它們會處於 「未設」 狀態

1229
01:02:02,177 --> 01:02:07,746
And yeah, in this case though, maybe you want your program to crash, okay?
在這個情況下，說不定你就希望你的程序 crash？對不對？

1230
01:02:07,748 --> 01:02:11,850
You might want your program to crash, because if you had a button, that never
你也許就是希望自己的程序 crash，因為如果你有一個按鍵，

1231
01:02:11,852 --> 01:02:15,920
had its title set, and it's sending a pen digit to your controller, you probably
但是它的標題從未被 set，並且它傳了一個數字給你的 controller，你也許

1232
01:02:15,922 --> 01:02:20,358
wanna have that crash, so you can find that bug, before you ship your program.
想在你的程序見客戶之前，你就能找到 bug，所以你希望它 crash

1233
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:23,360
You see why sometimes fra, crashing is good?
現在你知道為什麼有時候程序 crash 是個好事吧

1234
01:02:23,362 --> 01:02:26,763
Now if you don't wanna crash, there's a way to get around that as well.
現在如果你不想你的程序 crash ，這裡有一個方法來解決

1235
01:02:26,765 --> 01:02:28,164
And I'll show you that a little bit later.
我等一下下展示給你們看，

1236
01:02:28,166 --> 01:02:32,802
But for now understanding that that's what this exclamation point does.
但是現在，先弄明白這個感嘆號是幹甚麼的

1237
01:02:32,804 --> 01:02:35,638
It unwraps that optional and crashes if it's nil.
它解包了 optional，如果它是 nil 就 crash

1238
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:38,040
But if it's not nil, it gets to the String or
但如果不是 nil，它是得到 String 或者

1239
01:02:38,042 --> 01:02:40,809
whatever the optional type is out of there for you.
其他的 optional 解包後的類型？

1240
01:02:40,811 --> 01:02:44,579
So now let's go ahead and run again and
所以讓我們繼續，重新運行一次，

1241
01:02:44,581 --> 01:02:51,318
we're gonna see that digit equals is gonna say the number, 'kay?
我們將看看是不是能得到 「digit = 」 對應的數字？

1242
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:56,556
It's got the String off the currentTitle, no more optional in there, okay?
我們得到了 currentTitle 的 String，不再是 optional 的類型了

1243
01:02:56,558 --> 01:02:59,492
Good?
看上去不錯

1244
01:02:59,494 --> 01:03:03,362
All right, so, now, what are we gonna do with that digit?
好的，現在，我們要用這些 digit 做什麼呢？

1245
01:03:03,364 --> 01:03:06,715
We got the digit,
我們已經能得到了數字

1246
01:03:06,716 --> 01:03:10,067
we want to append it onto the end of this display right here, okay.
我們希望按的數字能顯示並附加在這裡的末尾

1247
01:03:10,070 --> 01:03:13,972
And so let's just do that by saying display, dot.
所以讓我們輸入 display.

1248
01:03:13,974 --> 01:03:17,241
Now, again, if we have the documentation,I'd go look in the documentation and
現在繼續，如果我們查文檔

1249
01:03:17,243 --> 01:03:21,712
it would say oh, there's a property on UILabel, which is what display is,
它會告訴我們，UILabel 有一個屬性，這個屬性告訴我們 display 是什麼，

1250
01:03:21,714 --> 01:03:23,046
display is a UILabel.
負責顯示 UILabel 應該顯示的什麼

1251
01:03:23,048 --> 01:03:25,982
There's a property and it' called text.
這個屬性叫做 text

1252
01:03:25,984 --> 01:03:28,518
See it right there?
就在這裡

1253
01:03:28,519 --> 01:03:31,053
And actually, you can even see right here, the type of that, it's an optional as
而且實際上，輸入這個，你能在這裡看到，這是一個 optional

1254
01:03:31,056 --> 01:03:36,225
well, because this label's text might not have been set either, okay?
所以這個 label 的 text 應該還沒有設值

1255
01:03:36,227 --> 01:03:39,061
So it has to be an optional String, okay?
所以這裡是 optional String

1256
01:03:39,063 --> 01:03:43,297
So I'm just gonna set that equal now, display that text as an optional, so
所以我現在要用等號設值，顯示的 text 作為一個 optional

1257
01:03:43,299 --> 01:03:46,567
what values can I send it to,set it to?
什麼值可以設給它？

1258
01:03:46,569 --> 01:03:51,705
I could set it to nil, that would be legal because it's an optional,
我可以設成 nil，因為它是一個 optional，所以它是完全合法的

1259
01:03:51,707 --> 01:03:53,940
see, no warnings, no errors.
看，沒有警告也沒有錯誤

1260
01:03:53,942 --> 01:03:55,475
That would clear out that display.
這將什麼也不顯示

1261
01:03:55,477 --> 01:03:57,943
It would not be set to anything, or
它不能設值成其他東西，

1262
01:03:57,945 --> 01:04:00,979
I can set it to a String because it's an optional String.
我能給它設一個 String 值，因為它是一個 optional String

1263
01:04:00,981 --> 01:04:03,682
So I'm going to set it to a String and the String I'm going to set it
所以我將把它設值一個 String

1264
01:04:03,684 --> 01:04:08,586
to is display.text, what's currently in there, plus digit, okay?
這個 String 我設置成 display.text ，這裡加個數字

1265
01:04:08,588 --> 01:04:10,087
So I'm going to append that digit on.
這樣子就能附加數字上去了

1266
01:04:10,089 --> 01:04:11,655
Let's get rid of that.
讓我們擺脫刪掉這句

1267
01:04:11,657 --> 01:04:14,124
Okay, now, this has an error here.
好吧，現在又有一個錯誤

1268
01:04:14,126 --> 01:04:15,025
Why does this have an error?
這個錯誤是為什麼呢？為什麼這裡有個錯誤呢？

1269
01:04:15,027 --> 01:04:17,093
Anyone volunteer why this is an error?
有誰自願回答這裡為什麼有個錯誤？

1270
01:04:17,095 --> 01:04:18,661
See it's pointing right here.
發現錯誤指向這裡

1271
01:04:18,663 --> 01:04:21,897
There's an error, back there.
這裡有個錯誤，後面那位同學回答

1272
01:04:21,899 --> 01:04:24,733
The display.text is an optional String.
display.text 是一個 optional String

1273
01:04:24,735 --> 01:04:27,702
Bingo. Because display.text right here is not
答對了，因為這裡的 display.text 它不是個 String，

1274
01:04:27,704 --> 01:04:33,341
a String, it's an optional, and you can't add a String to an optional.
你不能將一個 String 後附加一個 optional

1275
01:04:33,343 --> 01:04:35,476
You can only add Strings to other Strings.
你只能將一個 String 附加在另外的 String 上

1276
01:04:35,478 --> 01:04:39,813
So we need to turn this into a String by unwrapping it.
所以我們通過解包 optioanl，將 optioanl 轉變為 String

1277
01:04:39,815 --> 01:04:44,250
And again, yes, this would crash if the display currently has nothing in it,
對的，這個東西會 crash，如果 display 沒有值

1278
01:04:44,252 --> 01:04:46,185
it's not set, okay?
現在還沒有設值

1279
01:04:46,187 --> 01:04:48,887
Are we cool with that?
大家都瞭解這個了吧？

1280
01:04:48,889 --> 01:04:49,821
So let's run again.
再讓我們運行一次

1281
01:04:49,823 --> 01:04:52,857
[BLANK_AUDIO]
[背景音]

1282
01:04:52,859 --> 01:04:54,058
All right.
好的

1283
01:04:54,060 --> 01:04:57,461
So now 5, oh, it put the 5 on there.
所以現在點擊 5，噢，5 顯示在這裡了

1284
01:04:57,463 --> 01:04:58,762
6, excellent.
點擊 6，好極了

1285
01:04:58,764 --> 01:05:00,497
It's kinda working.
它能夠工作了

1286
01:05:00,499 --> 01:05:02,565
I don't really like that 0 though.
這個 0 在這裡我很不喜歡

1287
01:05:02,567 --> 01:05:03,966
That's kinda weak, 0, 5, 6.
這裡就有點問題，5 和 6 前面有個 0

1288
01:05:03,968 --> 01:05:06,669
That should not,
這樣子是不對的

1289
01:05:06,670 --> 01:05:09,371
that 0 should've gotten cleared out, right, when I first typed that 5.
這個 0 應該在我按下 5 的時候就清除掉

1290
01:05:09,374 --> 01:05:12,808
And that's because we really need some way in our controller to know whether we're in
這是因為我們確實需要一些方法讓我們的 controller 知道我們是否在

1291
01:05:12,810 --> 01:05:14,777
the middle of typing a number right now.
已經輸入了數字

1292
01:05:14,778 --> 01:05:16,745
Because if we're in the middle of typing a number, we want to append, but
因為如果我們在一個已經輸入了數字，我們是希望數字加在後面，

1293
01:05:16,747 --> 01:05:18,079
if we're not in the middle of typing a number,
但是如果我們還沒開始輸入數字，

1294
01:05:18,081 --> 01:05:21,182
we want to start a new number, right?
我們想要開始輸入的是一個新的數字（而不是在 0 後面附加新數字），對吧？

1295
01:05:21,184 --> 01:05:27,021
So, let's do that, and I'm going to do that by adding a property, okay?
所以，讓我們通過添加一個 property 來實現這個效果

1296
01:05:27,023 --> 01:05:35,628
var userIsInTheMiddleOfTypingANumber , which you might say,
「var userIsInTheMiddleOfTypingANumber」，你也許會說，

1297
01:05:35,630 --> 01:05:38,464
oh my God, that terrible variable, now I have to type that over and over.
天哪，這麼糟糕的變量名字，每次都得這麼輸入還不得累死？

1298
01:05:38,466 --> 01:05:40,900
This is the last time I'll ever have to type that, okay?
其實下一次用到這個變量時我並不需要輸入這麼多的

1299
01:05:40,902 --> 01:05:44,169
Because Xcode is always going to escape complete it for me, okay?
因為下一次 Xcode 會幫我自動補齊的

1300
01:05:44,171 --> 01:05:48,840
So long names are perfectly fine, in terms of typing load anyway.
所以這麼長的名字沒有問題

1301
01:05:48,842 --> 01:05:50,608
So I like this name so I'm gonna keep it.
我就挺喜歡這個名字的，就這麼用了.

1302
01:05:50,610 --> 01:05:53,077
And it's a bool, okay.
這是一個布爾型數值

1303
01:05:53,079 --> 01:05:54,845
So I'm typing its, giving its type.
所以我輸入它，給了它的這個類型

1304
01:05:54,847 --> 01:06:01,618
So here's var name type, and notice, look at this little error right here, 'kay.
這個是變量名的類型，注意看這裡，有一個小的錯誤標記

1305
01:06:01,620 --> 01:06:06,222
Okay, sometimes you're gonna get errors in Swift that are completely incomprehensible
有時候你在 Swift 會遇到對你來說難以理解的錯誤

1306
01:06:06,224 --> 01:06:08,724
to you because you haven't learned enough of Swift.
這是因為你對 Swift 的瞭解還不夠深入

1307
01:06:08,726 --> 01:06:11,143
This one's kind of like that.
這個錯誤就是因為這個

1308
01:06:11,144 --> 01:06:13,561
You see, it says, class viewController has no initializers.
你看，這裡說，viewController 沒有初始化方法

1309
01:06:13,564 --> 01:06:19,667
And that's because, and pay attention, in Swift all properties
請注意，這是因為，在 Swift 里，

1310
01:06:19,669 --> 01:06:24,271
have to be initialized when the object is initialized.
當一個對象初始化了，那麼這個對象的所有屬性都必須要初始化

1311
01:06:24,273 --> 01:06:29,142
Okay, you can't have a property just sitting around not initialized,
所以你不能用沒有初始化的屬性，

1312
01:06:29,144 --> 01:06:30,977
they have to have a value.
它們需要一個值，

1313
01:06:30,979 --> 01:06:32,862
Now if they're an optional,
現在，它們是一個 optional，

1314
01:06:32,863 --> 01:06:34,746
their value can be nil, but they have to have some value.
它們的值可以為 nil，但是它們必須有值

1315
01:06:34,749 --> 01:06:37,750
So we can't have this have no value.
所以我們不能在它們沒有值前使用

1316
01:06:37,752 --> 01:06:40,052
Now there's two ways to give it a value.
有兩種方法給它設值，

1317
01:06:40,054 --> 01:06:42,087
One is, with an initializer.
一種就是用初始化方法，

1318
01:06:42,089 --> 01:06:45,156
Unfortunately, I'm not gonna teach that to you until next week, so
但是不幸的是，這種方法要下周才會教你們，

1319
01:06:45,158 --> 01:06:46,557
you can't do it that way.
你還不能用這種方法

1320
01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:51,228
Another way is just to say what it equals right here, okay?
所以另外一種方法就是對其直接賦值

1321
01:06:51,230 --> 01:06:55,298
And boom, gets rid of all our errors, obviously we don't start out in
一下子，所有錯誤都解決了 很明顯我們

1322
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:59,402
the middle of typing a number,so we're good to go here, all right.
不會一開始就有數字，所以這樣就很好了

1323
01:07:01,105 --> 01:07:04,373
So now we have, we know whether the use is in the middle of typing a number.
現在我們就知道了什麼時候輸入了數字

1324
01:07:04,375 --> 01:07:06,241
We can go down here and say if the user,
我們能從這裡繼續深入，如果說用戶 ——

1325
01:07:06,243 --> 01:07:12,246
now again, I'm just gonna hit Tab to jump past this, maybe a couple times.
再一次，按一下 Tab 跳過這些，可能還要多按幾次，找到這個 ——

1326
01:07:12,248 --> 01:07:14,648
But if the user's in the middle of typing a number,
但是如果用戶正在輸入數字，

1327
01:07:14,650 --> 01:07:17,184
then we'll do what we were doing before.
那就和剛才我們剛剛做的操作一樣，

1328
01:07:17,186 --> 01:07:21,187
Otherwise, we're just gonna set the display.text equal to the new digit we
不然的話，如果我們設置 「display.text = 」

1329
01:07:21,189 --> 01:07:24,557
just typed, 'kay?
我們剛剛輸入的新數字

1330
01:07:24,558 --> 01:07:27,926
And we're gonna say that the user is now in the middle of typing a number.
這就表示了用戶現在正在輸入數字

1331
01:07:27,928 --> 01:07:30,062
Question?
什麼問題？

1332
01:07:30,063 --> 01:07:32,197
Why would we have to do [INAUDIBLE] to display it?
[學生提問]

1333
01:07:32,199 --> 01:07:34,833
Initialize?
[學生提問]

1334
01:07:34,835 --> 01:07:37,669
Why did we not have to initialize this?
為什麼我們沒有初始化這個？

1335
01:07:37,671 --> 01:07:39,988
That's a fantastic question and
這是個非常棒的的問題，

1336
01:07:39,989 --> 01:07:42,306
I'm gonna talk about that on Wednesday cuz there's only one minute left.
我將在週三說這個問題，因為現在只剩下一分鐘了

1337
01:07:42,308 --> 01:07:44,908
But that is a great question and it'll also, when I talk about it,
在我下次說到的時候，這依然是個很好的問題

1338
01:07:44,910 --> 01:07:48,679
I'm gonna tell you why this is an exclamation point and not a question mark.
我將會說一下為什麼這裡是個感嘆號而不是個問號，

1339
01:07:48,681 --> 01:07:52,548
Because I told you that optionals are made with question marks.
因為我之前說過 optional 都是由問號組成的，

1340
01:07:52,550 --> 01:07:55,318
So why the heck is this optional?
但是為什麼這個 optional 是這樣的？

1341
01:07:55,319 --> 01:07:58,087
Cuz that's what it is, an exclamation point, so we'll talk about that next time.

01:07:58,089 --> 01:08:01,056
All right, so let's go ahead and run one last time here.
所以讓我們下次課繼續，

1343
01:08:01,058 --> 01:08:04,793
And hopefully this is gonna, this 0 will be cleared out, it is and
我們之前希望這個 0 可以被清掉，看來沒問題，看看這個，

1344
01:08:04,795 --> 01:08:07,696
hopefully this will continue to append, it is.
希望這個也可以正常的附加數字，看來也沒問題

1345
01:08:07,698 --> 01:08:11,532
So we're in a great spot right here, we've got a calculator,
我們今天已經有了一個不錯的開始，我們已經有一個計算器了，

1346
01:08:11,534 --> 01:08:16,904
we can enter numbers in it, next step is, we gotta make it do some calculating, and
我們已經能夠輸入數字了，下一步我們將讓其能夠計算，

1347
01:08:16,906 --> 01:08:19,406
we're gonna do that next time so I will see you then.
我們下節課再來實現，大家下節課見
